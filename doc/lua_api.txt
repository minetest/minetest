Minetest Lua Modding API Reference 0.4.dev
==========================================
More information at http://c55.me/minetest/

Introduction
-------------
Content and functionality can be added to Minetest 0.4 by using Lua
scripting in run-time loaded mods.

A mod is a self-contained bunch of scripts, textures and other related
things that is loaded by and interfaces with Minetest.

Mods are contained and ran solely on the server side. Definitions and media
files are automatically transferred to the client.

If you see a deficiency in the API, feel free to attempt to add the
functionality in the engine and API. You can send such improvements as
source code patches to <celeron55@gmail.com>.

Programming in Lua
-------------------
If you have any difficulty in understanding this, please read:
  http://www.lua.org/pil/

Startup
--------
Mods are loaded during server startup from the mod load paths by running
the init.lua scripts.

Mod load path
-------------
Generic:
  $path_share/games/gameid/mods/
  $path_share/mods/gameid/
  $path_user/games/gameid/mods/
  $path_user/mods/gameid/ <-- User-installed mods
  $worldpath/worldmods/

In a run-in-place version (eg. the distributed windows version):
  minetest-0.4.x/games/gameid/mods/
  minetest-0.4.x/mods/gameid/ <-- User-installed mods
  minetest-0.4.x/worlds/worldname/worldmods/

On an installed version on linux:
  /usr/share/minetest/games/gameid/mods/
  ~/.minetest/mods/gameid/ <-- User-installed mods
  ~/.minetest/worlds/worldname/worldmods

Mod directory structure
------------------------
mods
|-- modname
|   |-- depends.txt
|   |-- init.lua
|   |-- textures
|   |   |-- modname_stuff.png
|   |   `-- modname_something_else.png
|   `-- <custom data>
`-- another

modname:
  The location of this directory can be fetched by using
  minetest.get_modpath(modname)

depends.txt:
  List of mods that have to be loaded before loading this mod.
  A single line contains a single modname.

init.lua:
  The main Lua script. Running this script should register everything it
  wants to register. Subsequent execution depends on minetest calling the
  registered callbacks.

  minetest.setting_get(name) and minetest.setting_getbool(name) can be used
  to read custom or existing settings at load time, if necessary.

textures:
  These textures will be transferred to the client and can be referred to
  by the mod.

Naming convention for registered textual names
----------------------------------------------
Registered names should generally be in this format:
  "modname:<whatever>" (<whatever> can have characters a-zA-Z0-9_)

This is to prevent conflicting names from corrupting maps and is
enforced by the mod loader.

Example: mod "experimental", ideal item/node/entity name "tnt":
         -> the name should be "experimental:tnt".

Enforcement can be overridden by prefixing the name with ":". This can
be used for overriding the registrations of some other mod.

Example: Any mod can redefine experimental:tnt by using the name
         ":experimental:tnt" when registering it.
(also that mod is required to have "experimental" as a dependency)

The ":" prefix can also be used for maintaining backwards compatibility.

Aliases
-------
Aliases can be added by using minetest.register_alias(name, convert_to)

This will make Minetest to convert things called name to things called
convert_to.

This can be used for maintaining backwards compatibility.

This can be also used for setting quick access names for things, eg. if
you have an item called epiclylongmodname:stuff, you could do
  minetest.register_alias("stuff", "epiclylongmodname:stuff")
and be able to use "/giveme stuff".

Textures
--------
Mods should generally prefix their textures with modname_, eg. given
the mod name "foomod", a texture could be called
  "foomod_foothing.png"

Representations of simple things
--------------------------------
MapNode representation:
  {name="name", param1=num, param2=num}

MapNodes do not directly have any other data associated with them.
If you want to access the definition of the node, you access
  minetest.registered_nodes[node.name]

param1 and param2 are 8 bit and 4 bit integers, respectively. They
are reserved for certain automated functions. If you don't use these
functions, you can use them to store arbitrary values.

param1 is reserved for the engine when:
  paramtype != "none"
param2 is reserved for the engine when any of these are used:
  liquidtype == "flowing"
  drawtype == "flowingliquid"
  drawtype == "torchlike"
  drawtype == "signlike"

Position/vector:
  {x=num, y=num, z=num}
Currently the API does not provide any helper functions for addition,
subtraction and whatever; you can define those that you need yourself.

stackstring/itemstring: A stack of items in serialized format.
eg. 'default:dirt 5'
eg. 'default:pick_wood 21323'
eg. 'default:apple'

item: A stack of items in Lua table format.
eg. {name="default:dirt", count=5, wear=0, metadata=""} 
    ^ 5 dirt nodes
eg. {name="default:pick_wood", count=1, wear=21323, metadata=""}
    ^ a wooden pick about 1/3 weared out
eg. {name="default:apple", count=1, wear=0, metadata=""}
    ^ an apple.

Any time an item must be passed to a function, it can be an
ItemStack (see below), an itemstring or a table in the above format.

SimpleSoundSpec:
eg. ""
eg. "default_place_node"
eg. {}
eg. {name="default_place_node"}
eg. {name="default_place_node", gain=1.0}

Items
------
Node (register_node):
  A node from the world
Tool (register_tool):
  A tool/weapon that can dig and damage things according to tool_capabilities
Craftitem (register_craftitem):
  A miscellaneous item

Groups
-------
In a number of places, there is a group table. Groups define the
properties of a thing (item, node, armor of entity, capabilities of
tool) in such a way that the engine and other mods can can interact with
the thing without actually knowing what the thing is.

Usage:
- Groups are stored in a table, having the group names with keys and the
  group ratings as values. For example:
    groups = {crumbly=3, soil=1}
    ^ Default dirt (soil group actually currently not defined; TODO)
    groups = {crumbly=2, soil=1, level=2, outerspace=1}
    ^ A more special dirt-kind of thing
- Groups always have a rating associated with them. If there is no
  useful meaning for a rating for an enabled group, it shall be 1.
- When not defined, the rating of a group defaults to 0. Thus when you
  read groups, you must interpret nil and 0 as the same value, 0.

Groups of items
----------------
Groups of items can define what kind of an item it is (eg. wool).

Groups of nodes
----------------
In addition to the general item things, whether a node is diggable and how
long it takes is defined by using groups.

Groups of entities
-------------------
For entities, groups are, as of now, used only for calculating damage.

object.get_armor_groups() -> a group-rating table (eg. {fleshy=3})
object.set_armor_groups({level=2, fleshy=2, cracky=2})

Groups of tools
----------------
Groups in tools define which groups of nodes and entities they are
effective towards.

Groups in crafting recipes
---------------------------
- Not implemented yet. (TODO)
- Will probably look like this:
{
    output = 'food:meat_soup_raw',
    recipe = {
        {'group:meat'},
        {'group:water'},
        {'group:bowl'},
    },
	preserve = {'group:bowl'},
}

Special groups
---------------
- immortal: Disables the group damage system for an entity
- level: Can be used to give an additional sense of progression in the game.
  - A larger level will cause eg. a weapon of a lower level make much less
    damage, and get weared out much faster, or not be able to get drops
	from destroyed nodes.
  - 0 is something that is directly accessible at the start of gameplay
- dig_immediate: (player can always pick up node without tool wear)
  - 2: node is removed without tool wear after 0.5 seconds or so
       (rail, sign)
  - 3: node is removed without tool wear immediately (torch)

Known damage and digging time defining groups
----------------------------------------------
- crumbly: dirt, sand
- cracky: tough but crackable stuff like stone.
- snappy: something that can be cut using fine tools; eg. leaves, small
          plants, wire, sheets of metal
- choppy: something that can be cut using force; eg. trees, wooden planks
- fleshy: Living things like animals and the player. This could imply
          some blood effects when hitting.
- explody: Especially prone to explosions
- oddly_breakable_by_hand:
   Can be added to nodes that shouldn't logically be breakable by the
   hand but are. Somewhat similar to dig_immediate, but times are more
   like {[1]=3.50,[2]=2.00,[3]=0.70} and this does not override the
   speed of a tool if the tool can dig at a larger speed than this
   suggests for the hand.

Examples of custom groups
--------------------------
Item groups are often used for defining, well, //groups of items//.
- meat: any meat-kind of a thing (rating might define the size or healing
  ability or be irrelevant - it is not defined as of yet)
- eatable: anything that can be eaten. Rating might define HP gain in half
  hearts.
- flammable: can be set on fire. Rating might define the intensity of the
  fire, affecting eg. the speed of the spreading of an open fire.
- wool: any wool (any origin, any color)
- metal: any metal
- weapon: any weapon
- heavy: anything considerably heavy

Digging time calculation specifics
-----------------------------------
Groups such as **crumbly**, **cracky** and **snappy** are used for this
purpose. Rating is 1, 2 or 3. A higher rating for such a group implies
faster digging time.

Also, the **level** group is used.

Tools define their properties by a list of parameters for groups. They
cannot dig other groups; thus it is important to use a standard bunch of
groups to enable interaction with tools.

**Example definition of the digging capabilities of a tool:**
tool_capabilities = {
	full_punch_interval=1.5,
	max_drop_level=1,
	groupcaps={
		crumbly={maxwear=0.01, maxlevel=2, times={[1]=0.80, [2]=0.60, [3]=0.40}}
	}
}

**Tools define:**
  * Full punch interval Maximum drop level For an arbitrary list of groups:
  * Maximum level (usually 0, 1, 2 or 3) Maximum wear (0...1) Digging times

**Full punch interval**: When used as a weapon, the tool will do full
damage if this time is spent between punches. If eg. half the time is
spent, the tool will do half damage.

**Maximum drop level** suggests the maximum level of node, when dug with
the tool, that will drop it's useful item. (eg. iron ore to drop a lump of
iron).

**Maximum level** tells what is the maximum level of a node of this group
that the tool will be able to dig.

**Maximum wear** determines how much the tool wears out when it is used for
digging a node, of this group, of the maximum level. For lower leveled
tools, the wear is divided by //4// to the exponent //level difference//.
This means for a maximum wear of 0.1, a level difference 1 will result in
wear=0.1/4=0.025, and a level difference of 2 will result in
wear=0.1/(4*4)=0.00625.

**Digging times** is basically a list of digging times for different
ratings of the group. It also determines the damage done to entities, based
on their "armor groups".
  * For example, as a lua table, ''times={2=2.00, 3=0.70}''. This would
  * result the tool to be able to dig nodes that have a rating of 2 or 3
  * for this group, and unable to dig the rating 1, which is the toughest.
  * Unless there is a matching group that enables digging otherwise.  For
  * entities, damage equals the amount of nodes dug in the time spent
  * between hits, with a maximum of ''full_punch_interval''.

Entity damage mechanism
------------------------
Client predicts damage based on damage groups. Because of this, it is able to
give an immediate response when an entity is damaged or dies; the response is
pre-defined somehow (eg. by defining a sprite animation) (not implemented;
TODO).

The group **immortal** will completely disable normal damage.

Entities can define a special armor group, which is **punch_operable**. This
group will disable the regular damage mechanism for players punching it by hand
or a non-tool item.

On the Lua side, every punch calls ''entity:on_punch(puncher,
time_from_last_punch, tool_capabilities, direction)''. This should never be
called directly, because damage is usually not handled by the entity itself.
  * ''puncher'' is the object performing the punch. Can be nil. Should never be
    accessed unless absolutely required.
  * ''time_from_last_punch'' is time from last punch (by puncher) or nil.
  * ''tool_capabilities'' can be nil.
  * ''direction'' is a unit vector, pointing from the source of the punch to
    the punched object.

To punch an entity/object in Lua, call ''object:punch(puncher, time_from_last_punch, tool_capabilities, direction)''.
  * Return value is tool wear.
  * Parameters are equal to the above callback.
  * If ''direction'' is nil and ''puncher'' is not nil, ''direction'' will be
    automatically filled in based on the location of ''puncher''.

  - The original prototype stuff is visible directly via a metatable
- Callbacks:
  - on_activate(self, staticdata)
    ^ Called when the object is instantiated.
  - on_step(self, dtime)
    ^ Called on every server tick (dtime is usually 0.05 seconds)
  - on_punch(self, puncher, time_from_last_punch, tool_capabilities, dir)
    ^ Called when somebody punches the object.
    ^ Note that you probably want to handle most punches using the
      automatic armor group system.
    ^ puncher: ObjectRef (can be nil)
    ^ time_from_last_punch: Meant for disallowing spamming of clicks (can be nil)
    ^ tool_capabilities: capability table of used tool (can be nil)
	^ dir: unit vector of direction of punch. Always defined. Points from
	       the puncher to the punched.
  - on_rightclick(self, clicker)
  - get_staticdata(self)
    ^ Should return a string that will be passed to on_activate when
      the object is instantiated the next time.
