Minetest Lua Modding API Reference 0.4.13
=========================================
* More information at <http://www.minetest.net/>
* Developer Wiki: <http://dev.minetest.net/>

Introduction
------------
Content and functionality can be added to Minetest 0.4 by using Lua
scripting in run-time loaded mods.

A mod is a self-contained bunch of scripts, textures and other related
things that is loaded by and interfaces with Minetest.

Mods are contained and ran solely on the server side. Definitions and media
files are automatically transferred to the client.

If you see a deficiency in the API, feel free to attempt to add the
functionality in the engine and API. You can send such improvements as
source code patches to <celeron55@gmail.com>.

Programming in Lua
------------------
If you have any difficulty in understanding this, please read
[Programming in Lua](http://www.lua.org/pil/).

Startup
-------
Mods are loaded during server startup from the mod load paths by running
the `init.lua` scripts in a shared environment.

Paths
-----
* `RUN_IN_PLACE=1` (Windows release, local build)
    *  `$path_user`:
        * Linux: `<build directory>`
        * Windows: `<build directory>`
    * `$path_share`
        * Linux: `<build directory>`
        * Windows:  `<build directory>`
* `RUN_IN_PLACE=0`: (Linux release)
    * `$path_share`
        * Linux: `/usr/share/minetest`
        * Windows: `<install directory>/minetest-0.4.x`
    * `$path_user`:
        * Linux: `$HOME/.minetest`
        * Windows: `C:/users/<user>/AppData/minetest` (maybe)

Games
-----
Games are looked up from:

* `$path_share/games/gameid/`
* `$path_user/games/gameid/`

where `gameid` is unique to each game.

The game directory contains the file `game.conf`, which contains these fields:

    name = <Human-readable full name of the game>

e.g.

    name = Minetest

The game directory can contain the file minetest.conf, which will be used
to set default settings when running the particular game.

### Menu images

Games can provide custom main menu images. They are put inside a `menu` directory inside the game directory.

The images are named `$identifier.png`, where `$identifier` is one of `overlay,background,footer,header`.
If you want to specify multiple images for one identifier, add additional images named like `$identifier.$n.png`, with an ascending number $n starting with 1,
and a random image will be chosen from the provided ones.


Mod load path
-------------
Generic:

* `$path_share/games/gameid/mods/`
* `$path_share/mods/`
* `$path_user/games/gameid/mods/`
* `$path_user/mods/` (User-installed mods)
* `$worldpath/worldmods/`

In a run-in-place version (e.g. the distributed windows version):

* `minetest-0.4.x/games/gameid/mods/`
* `minetest-0.4.x/mods/` (User-installed mods)
* `minetest-0.4.x/worlds/worldname/worldmods/`

On an installed version on Linux:

* `/usr/share/minetest/games/gameid/mods/`
* `$HOME/.minetest/mods/` (User-installed mods)
* `$HOME/.minetest/worlds/worldname/worldmods`

Mod load path for world-specific games
--------------------------------------
It is possible to include a game in a world; in this case, no mods or
games are loaded or checked from anywhere else.

This is useful for e.g. adventure worlds.

This happens if the following directory exists:

    $world/game/

Mods should be then be placed in:

    $world/game/mods/

Modpack support
----------------
Mods can be put in a subdirectory, if the parent directory, which otherwise
should be a mod, contains a file named `modpack.txt`. This file shall be
empty, except for lines starting with `#`, which are comments.

Mod directory structure
------------------------

    mods
    |-- modname
    |   |-- depends.txt
    |   |-- screenshot.png
    |   |-- description.txt
    |   |-- init.lua
    |   |-- models
    |   |-- textures
    |   |   |-- modname_stuff.png
    |   |   `-- modname_something_else.png
    |   |-- sounds
    |   |-- media
    |   `-- <custom data>
    `-- another


### modname
The location of this directory can be fetched by using
`minetest.get_modpath(modname)`.

### `depends.txt`
List of mods that have to be loaded before loading this mod.

A single line contains a single modname.

Optional dependencies can be defined by appending a question mark
to a single modname. Their meaning is that if the specified mod
is missing, that does not prevent this mod from being loaded.

### `screenshot.png`
A screenshot shown in modmanager within mainmenu.

### `description.txt`
A File containing description to be shown within mainmenu.

### `init.lua`
The main Lua script. Running this script should register everything it
wants to register. Subsequent execution depends on minetest calling the
registered callbacks.

`minetest.setting_get(name)` and `minetest.setting_getbool(name)` can be used
to read custom or existing settings at load time, if necessary.

### `models`
Models for entities or meshnodes.

### `textures`, `sounds`, `media`
Media files (textures, sounds, whatever) that will be transferred to the
client and will be available for use by the mod.

Naming convention for registered textual names
----------------------------------------------
Registered names should generally be in this format:

    "modname:<whatever>" (<whatever> can have characters a-zA-Z0-9_)

This is to prevent conflicting names from corrupting maps and is
enforced by the mod loader.

### Example
In the mod `experimental`, there is the ideal item/node/entity name `tnt`.
So the name should be `experimental:tnt`.

Enforcement can be overridden by prefixing the name with `:`. This can
be used for overriding the registrations of some other mod.

Example: Any mod can redefine `experimental:tnt` by using the name

    :experimental:tnt

when registering it.
(also that mod is required to have `experimental` as a dependency)

The `:` prefix can also be used for maintaining backwards compatibility.

### Aliases
Aliases can be added by using `minetest.register_alias(name, convert_to)`.

This will make Minetest to convert things called name to things called
`convert_to`.

This can be used for maintaining backwards compatibility.

This can be also used for setting quick access names for things, e.g. if
you have an item called `epiclylongmodname:stuff`, you could do

    minetest.register_alias("stuff", "epiclylongmodname:stuff")

and be able to use `/giveme stuff`.

Textures
--------
Mods should generally prefix their textures with `modname_`, e.g. given
the mod name `foomod`, a texture could be called:

    foomod_foothing.png

Textures are referred to by their complete name, or alternatively by
stripping out the file extension:

* e.g. `foomod_foothing.png`
* e.g. `foomod_foothing`

Texture modifiers
-----------------
There are various texture modifiers that can be used
to generate textures on-the-fly.

### Texture overlaying
Textures can be overlaid by putting a `^` between them.

Example:

    default_dirt.png^default_grass_side.png

`default_grass_side.png` is overlayed over `default_dirt.png`.

### Texture grouping
Textures can be grouped together by enclosing them in `(` and `)`.

Example: `cobble.png^(thing1.png^thing2.png)`

A texture for `thing1.png^thing2.png` is created and the resulting
texture is overlaid over `cobble.png`.

### Advanced texture modifiers

#### `[crack:<n>:<p>`
* `<n>` = animation frame count
* `<p>` = current animation frame

Draw a step of the crack animation on the texture.

Example:

    default_cobble.png^[crack:10:1

#### `[combine:<w>x<h>:<x1>,<y1>=<file1>:<x2>,<y2>=<file2>`
* `<w>` = width
* `<h>` = height
* `<x1>`/`<x2>` = x positions
* `<y1>`/`<y1>` = y positions
* `<file1>`/`<file2>` = textures to combine

Create a texture of size `<w>` times `<h>` and blit `<file1>` to (`<x1>`,`<y1>`)
and blit `<file2>` to (`<x2>`,`<y2>`).

Example:

    [combine:16x32:0,0=default_cobble.png:0,16=default_wood.png

#### `[brighten`
Brightens the texture.

Example:

    tnt_tnt_side.png^[brighten

#### `[noalpha`
Makes the texture completely opaque.

Example:

    default_leaves.png^[noalpha

#### `[makealpha:<r>,<g>,<b>`
Convert one color to transparency.

Example:

    default_cobble.png^[makealpha:128,128,128

#### `[transform<t>`
* `<t>` = transformation(s) to apply

Rotates and/or flips the image.

`<t>` can be a number (between 0 and 7) or a transform name.
Rotations are counter-clockwise.

    0  I      identity
    1  R90    rotate by 90 degrees
    2  R180   rotate by 180 degrees
    3  R270   rotate by 270 degrees
    4  FX     flip X
    5  FXR90  flip X then rotate by 90 degrees
    6  FY     flip Y
    7  FYR90  flip Y then rotate by 90 degrees

Example:

    default_stone.png^[transformFXR90

#### `[inventorycube{<top>{<left>{<right>`
`^` is replaced by `&` in texture names.

Create an inventory cube texture using the side textures.

Example:

    [inventorycube{grass.png{dirt.png&grass_side.png{dirt.png&grass_side.png

Creates an inventorycube with `grass.png`, `dirt.png^grass_side.png` and
`dirt.png^grass_side.png` textures

#### `[lowpart:<percent>:<file>`
Blit the lower `<percent>`% part of `<file>` on the texture.

Example:

    base.png^[lowpart:25:overlay.png

#### `[verticalframe:<t>:<n>`
* `<t>` = animation frame count
* `<n>` = current animation frame

Crops the texture to a frame of a vertical animation.

Example:

    default_torch_animated.png^[verticalframe:16:8

#### `[mask:<file>`
Apply a mask to the base image.

The mask is applied using binary AND.

#### `[colorize:<color>:<ratio>`
Colorize the textures with the given color.
`<color>` is specified as a `ColorString`.
`<ratio>` is an int ranging from 0 to 255, and specifies how much of the
color to apply. If ommitted, the alpha will be used.

Sounds
------
Only Ogg Vorbis files are supported.

For positional playing of sounds, only single-channel (mono) files are
supported. Otherwise OpenAL will play them non-positionally.

Mods should generally prefix their sounds with `modname_`, e.g. given
the mod name "`foomod`", a sound could be called:

    foomod_foosound.ogg

Sounds are referred to by their name with a dot, a single digit and the
file extension stripped out. When a sound is played, the actual sound file
is chosen randomly from the matching sounds.

When playing the sound `foomod_foosound`, the sound is chosen randomly
from the available ones of the following files:

* `foomod_foosound.ogg`
* `foomod_foosound.0.ogg`
* `foomod_foosound.1.ogg`
* (...)
* `foomod_foosound.9.ogg`

Examples of sound parameter tables:

    -- Play location-less on all clients
    {
        gain = 1.0, -- default
    }
    -- Play location-less to a player
    {
        to_player = name,
        gain = 1.0, -- default
    }
    -- Play in a location
    {
        pos = {x=1,y=2,z=3},
        gain = 1.0, -- default
        max_hear_distance = 32, -- default
    }
    -- Play connected to an object, looped
    {
        object = <an ObjectRef>,
        gain = 1.0, -- default
        max_hear_distance = 32, -- default
        loop = true, -- only sounds connected to objects can be looped
    }

### `SimpleSoundSpec`
* e.g. `""`
* e.g. `"default_place_node"`
* e.g. `{}`
* e.g. `{name="default_place_node"}`
* e.g. `{name="default_place_node", gain=1.0}`

Registered definitions of stuff
-------------------------------
Anything added using certain `minetest.register_*` functions get added to
the global `minetest.registered_*` tables.

* `minetest.register_entity(name, prototype table)`
    * added to `minetest.registered_entities[name]`

* `minetest.register_node(name, node definition)`
    * added to `minetest.registered_items[name]`
    * added to `minetest.registered_nodes[name]`

* `minetest.register_tool(name, item definition)`
    * added to `minetest.registered_items[name]`

* `minetest.register_craftitem(name, item definition)`
    * added to `minetest.registered_items[name]`

* `minetest.register_biome(biome definition)`
    * returns an integer uniquely identifying the registered biome
    * added to `minetest.registered_biome` with the key of `biome.name`
    * if `biome.name` is nil, the key is the returned ID

* `minetest.register_ore(ore definition)`
    * returns an integer uniquely identifying the registered ore
    * added to `minetest.registered_ores` with the key of `ore.name`
    * if `ore.name` is nil, the key is the returned ID

* `minetest.register_decoration(decoration definition)`
    * returns an integer uniquely identifying the registered decoration
    * added to `minetest.registered_decorations` with the key of `decoration.name`
    * if `decoration.name` is nil, the key is the returned ID

* `minetest.register_schematic(schematic definition)`
    * returns an integer uniquely identifying the registered schematic
    * added to `minetest.registered_schematic` with the key of `schematic.name`
    * if `schematic.name` is nil, the key is the returned ID
    * if the schematic is loaded from a file, schematic.name is set to the filename
    * if the function is called when loading the mod, and schematic.name is a relative path,
    * then the current mod path will be prepended to the schematic filename

* `minetest.clear_registered_biomes()`
    * clears all biomes currently registered

* `minetest.clear_registered_ores()`
    * clears all ores currently registered

* `minetest.clear_registered_decorations()`
    * clears all decorations currently registered

* `minetest.clear_registered_schematics()`
    * clears all schematics currently registered

Note that in some cases you will stumble upon things that are not contained
in these tables (e.g. when a mod has been removed). Always check for
existence before trying to access the fields.

Example: If you want to check the drawtype of a node, you could do:

    local function get_nodedef_field(nodename, fieldname)
        if not minetest.registered_nodes[nodename] then
            return nil
        end
        return minetest.registered_nodes[nodename][fieldname]
    end
    local drawtype = get_nodedef_field(nodename, "drawtype")

Example: `minetest.get_item_group(name, group)` has been implemented as:

    function minetest.get_item_group(name, group)
        if not minetest.registered_items[name] or not
                minetest.registered_items[name].groups[group] then
            return 0
        end
        return minetest.registered_items[name].groups[group]
    end

Nodes
-----
Nodes are the bulk data of the world: cubes and other things that take the
space of a cube. Huge amounts of them are handled efficiently, but they
are quite static.

The definition of a node is stored and can be accessed by name in

    minetest.registered_nodes[node.name]

See "Registered definitions of stuff".

Nodes are passed by value between Lua and the engine.
They are represented by a table:

    {name="name", param1=num, param2=num}

`param1` and `param2` are 8-bit integers. The engine uses them for certain
automated functions. If you don't use these functions, you can use them to
store arbitrary values.

The functions of `param1` and `param2` are determined by certain fields in the
node definition:

`param1` is reserved for the engine when `paramtype != "none"`:

    paramtype = "light"
    ^ The value stores light with and without sun in its upper and lower 4 bits
      respectively. Allows light to propagate from or through the node with
      light value falling by 1 per node. This is essential for a light source
      node to spread its light.

`param2` is reserved for the engine when any of these are used:

    liquidtype == "flowing"
    ^ The level and some flags of the liquid is stored in param2
    drawtype == "flowingliquid"
    ^ The drawn liquid level is read from param2
    drawtype == "torchlike"
    drawtype == "signlike"
    paramtype2 == "wallmounted"
    ^ The rotation of the node is stored in param2. You can make this value
      by using minetest.dir_to_wallmounted().
    paramtype2 == "facedir"
    ^ The rotation of the node is stored in param2. Furnaces and chests are
      rotated this way. Can be made by using minetest.dir_to_facedir().
      Values range 0 - 23
      facedir modulo 4 = axisdir
      0 = y+    1 = z+    2 = z-    3 = x+    4 = x-    5 = y-
      facedir's two less significant bits are rotation around the axis
    paramtype2 == "leveled"
    collision_box = {
      type = "fixed",
      fixed = {
                {-0.5, -0.5, -0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5},
      },
    },
    ^ defines list of collision boxes for the node. If empty, collision boxes
      will be the same as nodeboxes, in case of any other nodes will be full cube
      as in the example above.

Nodes can also contain extra data. See "Node Metadata".

Node drawtypes
---------------
There are a bunch of different looking node types.

Look for examples in `games/minimal` or `games/minetest_game`.

* `normal`
* `airlike`
* `liquid`
* `flowingliquid`
* `glasslike`
* `glasslike_framed`
* `glasslike_framed_optional`
* `allfaces`
* `allfaces_optional`
* `torchlike`
* `signlike`
* `plantlike`
* `firelike`
* `fencelike`
* `raillike`
* `nodebox` -- See below. (**Experimental!**)
* `mesh` -- use models for nodes

`*_optional` drawtypes need less rendering time if deactivated (always client side).

Node boxes
-----------
Node selection boxes are defined using "node boxes"

The `nodebox` node drawtype allows defining visual of nodes consisting of
arbitrary number of boxes. It allows defining stuff like stairs. Only the
`fixed` and `leveled` box type is supported for these.

Please note that this is still experimental, and may be incompatibly
changed in the future.

A nodebox is defined as any of:

    {
        -- A normal cube; the default in most things
        type = "regular"
    }
    {
        -- A fixed box (facedir param2 is used, if applicable)
        type = "fixed",
        fixed = box OR {box1, box2, ...}
    }
    {
        -- A box like the selection box for torches
        -- (wallmounted param2 is used, if applicable)
        type = "wallmounted",
        wall_top = box,
        wall_bottom = box,
        wall_side = box
    }

A `box` is defined as:

    {x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2}

A box of a regular node would look like:

    {-0.5, -0.5, -0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5},

`type = "leveled"` is same as `type = "fixed"`, but `y2` will be automatically
set to level from `param2`.


Meshes
------
If drawtype `mesh` is used, tiles should hold model materials textures.
Only static meshes are implemented.
For supported model formats see Irrlicht engine documentation.


Noise Parameters
----------------
Noise Parameters, or commonly called "`NoiseParams`", define the properties of
perlin noise.

### `offset`
Offset that the noise is translated by (i.e. added) after calculation.

### `scale`
Factor that the noise is scaled by (i.e. multiplied) after calculation.

### `spread`
Vector containing values by which each coordinate is divided by before calculation.
Higher spread values result in larger noise features.

A value of `{x=250, y=250, z=250}` is common.

### `seed`
Random seed for the noise. Add the world seed to a seed offset for world-unique noise.
In the case of `minetest.get_perlin()`, this value has the world seed automatically added.

### `octaves`
Number of times the noise gradient is accumulated into the noise.

Increase this number to increase the amount of detail in the resulting noise.

A value of `6` is common.

### `persistence`
Factor by which the effect of the noise gradient function changes with each successive octave.

Values less than `1` make the details of successive octaves' noise diminish, while values
greater than `1` make successive octaves stronger.

A value of `0.6` is common.

### `lacunarity`
Factor by which the noise feature sizes change with each successive octave.

A value of `2.0` is common.

### `flags`
Leave this field unset for no special handling.

Currently supported are `defaults`, `eased` and `absvalue`.

#### `defaults`
Specify this if you would like to keep auto-selection of eased/not-eased while specifying
some other flags.

#### `eased`
Maps noise gradient values onto a quintic S-curve before performing interpolation.
This results in smooth, rolling noise. Disable this (`noeased`) for sharp-looking noise.
If no flags are specified (or defaults is), 2D noise is eased and 3D noise is not eased.

#### `absvalue`
Accumulates the absolute value of each noise gradient result.

Noise parameters format example for 2D or 3D perlin noise or perlin noise maps:
    np_terrain = {
        offset = 0,
        scale = 1,
        spread = {x=500, y=500, z=500},
        seed = 571347,
        octaves = 5,
        persist = 0.63,
        lacunarity = 2.0,
        flags = "defaults, absvalue"
    }
  ^ A single noise parameter table can be used to get 2D or 3D noise,
    when getting 2D noise spread.z is ignored.


Ore types
---------
These tell in what manner the ore is generated.

All default ores are of the uniformly-distributed scatter type.

### `scatter`
Randomly chooses a location and generates a cluster of ore.

If `noise_params` is specified, the ore will be placed if the 3D perlin noise at
that point is greater than the `noise_threshold`, giving the ability to create
a non-equal distribution of ore.

### `sheet`
Creates a sheet of ore in a blob shape according to the 2D perlin noise
described by `noise_params`. The relative height of the sheet can be
controlled by the same perlin noise as well, by specifying a non-zero
`scale` parameter in `noise_params`.

**IMPORTANT**: The noise is not transformed by `offset` or `scale` when comparing
against the noise threshold, but scale is used to determine relative height.
The height of the blob is randomly scattered, with a maximum height of `clust_size`.

`clust_scarcity` and `clust_num_ores` are ignored.

This is essentially an improved version of the so-called "stratus" ore seen in
some unofficial mods.

### `blob`
Creates a deformed sphere of ore according to 3d perlin noise described by
`noise_params`.  The maximum size of the blob is `clust_size`, and
`clust_scarcity` has the same meaning as with the `scatter` type.
### `vein
Creates veins of ore varying in density by according to the intersection of two
instances of 3d perlin noise with diffferent seeds, both described by
`noise_params`.  `random_factor` varies the influence random chance has on
placement of an ore inside the vein, which is `1` by default. Note that
modifying this parameter may require adjusting `noise_threshhold`.
The parameters `clust_scarcity`, `clust_num_ores`, and `clust_size` are ignored
by this ore type.  This ore type is difficult to control since it is sensitive
to small changes.  The following is a decent set of parameters to work from:

	noise_params = {
	    offset  = 0,
	    scale   = 3,
	    spread  = {x=200, y=200, z=200},
	    seed    = 5390,
	    octaves = 4,
	    persist = 0.5,
	    flags = "eased",
	},
	noise_threshhold = 1.6

WARNING:  Use this ore type *very* sparingly since it is ~200x more
computationally expensive than any other ore.

Ore attributes
--------------
See section "Flag Specifier Format".

Currently supported flags: `absheight`

### `absheight`
Also produce this same ore between the height range of `-y_max` and `-y_min`.

Useful for having ore in sky realms without having to duplicate ore entries.

Decoration types
----------------
The varying types of decorations that can be placed.

The default value is `simple`, and is currently the only type supported.

### `simple`
Creates a 1 times `H` times 1 column of a specified node (or a random node from
a list, if a decoration list is specified). Can specify a certain node it must
spawn next to, such as water or lava, for example. Can also generate a
decoration of random height between a specified lower and upper bound.
This type of decoration is intended for placement of grass, flowers, cacti,
papyri, and so on.

### `schematic`
Copies a box of `MapNodes` from a specified schematic file (or raw description).
Can specify a probability of a node randomly appearing when placed.
This decoration type is intended to be used for multi-node sized discrete
structures, such as trees, cave spikes, rocks, and so on.


Schematic specifier
--------------------
A schematic specifier identifies a schematic by either a filename to a
Minetest Schematic file (`.mts`) or through raw data supplied through Lua,
in the form of a table.  This table specifies the following fields:

* The `size` field is a 3D vector containing the dimensions of the provided schematic. (required)
* The `yslice_prob` field is a table of {ypos, prob} which sets the `ypos`th vertical slice
  of the schematic to have a `prob / 256 * 100` chance of occuring. (default: 255)
* The `data` field is a flat table of MapNode tables making up the schematic,
  in the order of `[z [y [x]]]`. (required)
  Each MapNode table contains:
  * `name`: the name of the map node to place (required)
  * `prob` (alias `param1`): the probability of this node being placed (default: 255)
  * `param2`: the raw param2 value of the node being placed onto the map (default: 0)
  * `force_place`: boolean representing if the node should forcibly overwrite any
     previous contents (default: false)

About probability values:
* A probability value of `0` or `1` means that node will never appear (0% chance).
* A probability value of `254` or `255` means the node will always appear (100% chance).
* If the probability value `p` is greater than `1`, then there is a
  `(p / 256 * 100)` percent chance that node will appear when the schematic is
  placed on the map.


Schematic attributes
--------------------
See section "Flag Specifier Format".

Currently supported flags: `place_center_x`, `place_center_y`,
			   `place_center_z`, `force_placement`.

* `place_center_x`: Placement of this decoration is centered along the X axis.
* `place_center_y`: Placement of this decoration is centered along the Y axis.
* `place_center_z`: Placement of this decoration is centered along the Z axis.
* `force_placement`: Schematic nodes other than "ignore" will replace existing nodes.


HUD element types
-----------------
The position field is used for all element types.

To account for differing resolutions, the position coordinates are the percentage
of the screen, ranging in value from `0` to `1`.

The name field is not yet used, but should contain a description of what the
HUD element represents. The direction field is the direction in which something
is drawn.

`0` draws from left to right, `1` draws from right to left, `2` draws from
top to bottom, and `3` draws from bottom to top.

The `alignment` field specifies how the item will be aligned. It ranges from `-1` to `1`,
with `0` being the center, `-1` is moved to the left/up, and `1` is to the right/down.
Fractional values can be used.

The `offset` field specifies a pixel offset from the position. Contrary to position,
the offset is not scaled to screen size. This allows for some precisely-positioned
items in the HUD.

**Note**: `offset` _will_ adapt to screen DPI as well as user defined scaling factor!

Below are the specific uses for fields in each type; fields not listed for that type are ignored.

**Note**: Future revisions to the HUD API may be incompatible; the HUD API is still
in the experimental stages.

### `image`
Displays an image on the HUD.

* `scale`: The scale of the image, with 1 being the original texture size.
  Only the X coordinate scale is used (positive values).
  Negative values represent that percentage of the screen it
  should take; e.g. `x=-100` means 100% (width).
* `text`: The name of the texture that is displayed.
* `alignment`: The alignment of the image.
* `offset`: offset in pixels from position.

### `text`
Displays text on the HUD.

* `scale`: Defines the bounding rectangle of the text.
  A value such as `{x=100, y=100}` should work.
* `text`: The text to be displayed in the HUD element.
* `number`: An integer containing the RGB value of the color used to draw the text.
  Specify `0xFFFFFF` for white text, `0xFF0000` for red, and so on.
* `alignment`: The alignment of the text.
* `offset`: offset in pixels from position.

### `statbar`
Displays a horizontal bar made up of half-images.

* `text`: The name of the texture that is used.
* `number`: The number of half-textures that are displayed.
  If odd, will end with a vertically center-split texture.
* `direction`
* `offset`: offset in pixels from position.
* `size`: If used, will force full-image size to this value (override texture pack image size)

### `inventory`
* `text`: The name of the inventory list to be displayed.
* `number`: Number of items in the inventory to be displayed.
* `item`: Position of item that is selected.
* `direction`

### `waypoint`
Displays distance to selected world position.

* `name`: The name of the waypoint.
* `text`: Distance suffix. Can be blank.
* `number:` An integer containing the RGB value of the color used to draw the text.
* `world_pos`: World position of the waypoint.

Representations of simple things
--------------------------------

### Position/vector

    {x=num, y=num, z=num}

For helper functions see "Vector helpers".

### `pointed_thing`
* `{type="nothing"}`
* `{type="node", under=pos, above=pos}`
* `{type="object", ref=ObjectRef}`

Flag Specifier Format
---------------------
Flags using the standardized flag specifier format can be specified in either of
two ways, by string or table.

The string format is a comma-delimited set of flag names; whitespace and
unrecognized flag fields are ignored. Specifying a flag in the string sets the
flag, and specifying a flag prefixed by the string `"no"` explicitly
clears the flag from whatever the default may be.

In addition to the standard string flag format, the schematic flags field can
also be a table of flag names to boolean values representing whether or not the
flag is set. Additionally, if a field with the flag name prefixed with `"no"`
is present, mapped to a boolean of any value, the specified flag is unset.

E.g. A flag field of value

    {place_center_x = true, place_center_y=false, place_center_z=true}

is equivalent to

    {place_center_x = true, noplace_center_y=true, place_center_z=true}

which is equivalent to

    "place_center_x, noplace_center_y, place_center_z"

or even

    "place_center_x, place_center_z"

since, by default, no schematic attributes are set.

Items
-----

### Item types
There are three kinds of items: nodes, tools and craftitems.

* Node (`register_node`): A node from the world.
* Tool (`register_tool`): A tool/weapon that can dig and damage
  things according to `tool_capabilities`.
* Craftitem (`register_craftitem`): A miscellaneous item.

### Item formats
Items and item stacks can exist in three formats: Serializes, table format
and `ItemStack`.

#### Serialized
This is called "stackstring" or "itemstring":

* e.g. `'default:dirt 5'`
* e.g. `'default:pick_wood 21323'`
* e.g. `'default:apple'`

#### Table format
Examples:

5 dirt nodes:

    {name="default:dirt", count=5, wear=0, metadata=""}

A wooden pick about 1/3 worn out:

    {name="default:pick_wood", count=1, wear=21323, metadata=""}

An apple:

    {name="default:apple", count=1, wear=0, metadata=""}

#### `ItemStack`
A native C++ format with many helper methods. Useful for converting
between formats. See the Class reference section for details.

When an item must be passed to a function, it can usually be in any of
these formats.


Groups
------
In a number of places, there is a group table. Groups define the
properties of a thing (item, node, armor of entity, capabilities of
tool) in such a way that the engine and other mods can can interact with
the thing without actually knowing what the thing is.

### Usage
Groups are stored in a table, having the group names with keys and the
group ratings as values. For example:

    groups = {crumbly=3, soil=1}
    -- ^ Default dirt

    groups = {crumbly=2, soil=1, level=2, outerspace=1}
    -- ^ A more special dirt-kind of thing

Groups always have a rating associated with them. If there is no
useful meaning for a rating for an enabled group, it shall be `1`.

When not defined, the rating of a group defaults to `0`. Thus when you
read groups, you must interpret `nil` and `0` as the same value, `0`.

You can read the rating of a group for an item or a node by using

    minetest.get_item_group(itemname, groupname)

### Groups of items
Groups of items can define what kind of an item it is (e.g. wool).

### Groups of nodes
In addition to the general item things, groups are used to define whether
a node is destroyable and how long it takes to destroy by a tool.

### Groups of entities
For entities, groups are, as of now, used only for calculating damage.
The rating is the percentage of damage caused by tools with this damage group.
See "Entity damage mechanism".

    object.get_armor_groups() --> a group-rating table (e.g. {fleshy=100})
    object.set_armor_groups({fleshy=30, cracky=80})

### Groups of tools
Groups in tools define which groups of nodes and entities they are
effective towards.

### Groups in crafting recipes
An example: Make meat soup from any meat, any water and any bowl:

    {
        output = 'food:meat_soup_raw',
        recipe = {
            {'group:meat'},
            {'group:water'},
            {'group:bowl'},
        },
        -- preserve = {'group:bowl'}, -- Not implemented yet (TODO)
    }

Another example: Make red wool from white wool and red dye:

    {
        type = 'shapeless',
        output = 'wool:red',
        recipe = {'wool:white', 'group:dye,basecolor_red'},
    }

### Special groups
* `immortal`: Disables the group damage system for an entity
* `level`: Can be used to give an additional sense of progression in the game.
     * A larger level will cause e.g. a weapon of a lower level make much less
       damage, and get worn out much faster, or not be able to get drops
       from destroyed nodes.
     * `0` is something that is directly accessible at the start of gameplay
     * There is no upper limit
* `dig_immediate`: (player can always pick up node without tool wear)
    * `2`: node is removed without tool wear after 0.5 seconds or so
      (rail, sign)
    * `3`: node is removed without tool wear immediately (torch)
* `disable_jump`: Player (and possibly other things) cannot jump from node
* `fall_damage_add_percent`: damage speed = `speed * (1 + value/100)`
* `bouncy`: value is bounce speed in percent
* `falling_node`: if there is no walkable block under the node it will fall
* `attached_node`: if the node under it is not a walkable block the node will be
  dropped as an item. If the node is wallmounted the wallmounted direction is
  checked.
* `soil`: saplings will grow on nodes in this group
* `connect_to_raillike`: makes nodes of raillike drawtype with same group value
  connect to each other

### Known damage and digging time defining groups
* `crumbly`: dirt, sand
* `cracky`: tough but crackable stuff like stone.
* `snappy`: something that can be cut using fine tools; e.g. leaves, small
  plants, wire, sheets of metal
* `choppy`: something that can be cut using force; e.g. trees, wooden planks
* `fleshy`: Living things like animals and the player. This could imply
  some blood effects when hitting.
* `explody`: Especially prone to explosions
* `oddly_breakable_by_hand`:
   Can be added to nodes that shouldn't logically be breakable by the
   hand but are. Somewhat similar to `dig_immediate`, but times are more
   like `{[1]=3.50,[2]=2.00,[3]=0.70}` and this does not override the
   speed of a tool if the tool can dig at a faster speed than this
   suggests for the hand.

### Examples of custom groups
Item groups are often used for defining, well, _groups of items_.
* `meat`: any meat-kind of a thing (rating might define the size or healing
  ability or be irrelevant -- it is not defined as of yet)
* `eatable`: anything that can be eaten. Rating might define HP gain in half
  hearts.
* `flammable`: can be set on fire. Rating might define the intensity of the
  fire, affecting e.g. the speed of the spreading of an open fire.
* `wool`: any wool (any origin, any color)
* `metal`: any metal
* `weapon`: any weapon
* `heavy`: anything considerably heavy

### Digging time calculation specifics
Groups such as `crumbly`, `cracky` and `snappy` are used for this
purpose. Rating is `1`, `2` or `3`. A higher rating for such a group implies
faster digging time.

The `level` group is used to limit the toughness of nodes a tool can dig
and to scale the digging times / damage to a greater extent.

**Please do understand this**, otherwise you cannot use the system to it's
full potential.

Tools define their properties by a list of parameters for groups. They
cannot dig other groups; thus it is important to use a standard bunch of
groups to enable interaction with tools.

#### Tools definition
Tools define:

* Full punch interval
* Maximum drop level
* For an arbitrary list of groups:
    * Uses (until the tool breaks)
        * Maximum level (usually `0`, `1`, `2` or `3`)
        * Digging times
        * Damage groups

#### Full punch interval
When used as a weapon, the tool will do full damage if this time is spent
between punches. If e.g. half the time is spent, the tool will do half
damage.

#### Maximum drop level
Suggests the maximum level of node, when dug with the tool, that will drop
it's useful item. (e.g. iron ore to drop a lump of iron).

This is not automated; it is the responsibility of the node definition
to implement this.

#### Uses
Determines how many uses the tool has when it is used for digging a node,
of this group, of the maximum level. For lower leveled nodes, the use count
is multiplied by `3^leveldiff`.

* `uses=10, leveldiff=0`: actual uses: 10
* `uses=10, leveldiff=1`: actual uses: 30
* `uses=10, leveldiff=2`: actual uses: 90

#### Maximum level
Tells what is the maximum level of a node of this group that the tool will
be able to dig.

#### Digging times
List of digging times for different ratings of the group, for nodes of the
maximum level.

For example, as a Lua table, `times={2=2.00, 3=0.70}`. This would
result in the tool to be able to dig nodes that have a rating of `2` or `3`
for this group, and unable to dig the rating `1`, which is the toughest.
Unless there is a matching group that enables digging otherwise.

#### Damage groups
List of damage for groups of entities. See "Entity damage mechanism".

#### Example definition of the capabilities of a tool

    tool_capabilities = {
        full_punch_interval=1.5,
        max_drop_level=1,
        groupcaps={
            crumbly={maxlevel=2, uses=20, times={[1]=1.60, [2]=1.20, [3]=0.80}}
        }
        damage_groups = {fleshy=2},
    }

This makes the tool be able to dig nodes that fulfil both of these:

* Have the `crumbly` group
* Have a `level` group less or equal to `2`

Table of resulting digging times:

    crumbly        0     1     2     3     4  <- level
         ->  0     -     -     -     -     -
             1  0.80  1.60  1.60     -     -
             2  0.60  1.20  1.20     -     -
             3  0.40  0.80  0.80     -     -

    level diff:    2     1     0    -1    -2

Table of resulting tool uses:

    ->  0     -     -     -     -     -
        1   180    60    20     -     -
        2   180    60    20     -     -
        3   180    60    20     -     -

**Notes**:

* At `crumbly==0`, the node is not diggable.
* At `crumbly==3`, the level difference digging time divider kicks in and makes
  easy nodes to be quickly breakable.
* At `level > 2`, the node is not diggable, because it's `level > maxlevel`

Entity damage mechanism
-----------------------
Damage calculation:

    damage = 0
    foreach group in cap.damage_groups:
        damage += cap.damage_groups[group] * limit(actual_interval /
               cap.full_punch_interval, 0.0, 1.0)
            * (object.armor_groups[group] / 100.0)
            -- Where object.armor_groups[group] is 0 for inexistent values
    return damage

Client predicts damage based on damage groups. Because of this, it is able to
give an immediate response when an entity is damaged or dies; the response is
pre-defined somehow (e.g. by defining a sprite animation) (not implemented;
TODO).
Currently a smoke puff will appear when an entity dies.

The group `immortal` completely disables normal damage.

Entities can define a special armor group, which is `punch_operable`. This
group disables the regular damage mechanism for players punching it by hand or
a non-tool item, so that it can do something else than take damage.

On the Lua side, every punch calls:

    entity:on_punch(puncher, time_from_last_punch, tool_capabilities, direction)

This should never be called directly, because damage is usually not handled by
the entity itself.

* `puncher` is the object performing the punch. Can be `nil`. Should never be
  accessed unless absolutely required, to encourage interoperability.
* `time_from_last_punch` is time from last punch (by `puncher`) or `nil`.
* `tool_capabilities` can be `nil`.
* `direction` is a unit vector, pointing from the source of the punch to
   the punched object.

To punch an entity/object in Lua, call:

    object:punch(puncher, time_from_last_punch, tool_capabilities, direction)

* Return value is tool wear.
* Parameters are equal to the above callback.
* If `direction` equals `nil` and `puncher` does not equal `nil`,
  `direction` will be automatically filled in based on the location of `puncher`.

Node Metadata
-------------
The instance of a node in the world normally only contains the three values
mentioned in "Nodes". However, it is possible to insert extra data into a
node. It is called "node metadata"; See "`NodeMetaRef`".

Metadata contains two things:
* A key-value store
* An inventory

Some of the values in the key-value store are handled specially:
* `formspec`: Defines a right-click inventory menu. See "Formspec".
* `infotext`: Text shown on the screen when the node is pointed at

Example stuff:

    local meta = minetest.get_meta(pos)
    meta:set_string("formspec",
            "size[8,9]"..
            "list[context;main;0,0;8,4;]"..
            "list[current_player;main;0,5;8,4;]")
    meta:set_string("infotext", "Chest");
    local inv = meta:get_inventory()
    inv:set_size("main", 8*4)
    print(dump(meta:to_table()))
    meta:from_table({
        inventory = {
            main = {[1] = "default:dirt", [2] = "", [3] = "", [4] = "",
                    [5] = "", [6] = "", [7] = "", [8] = "", [9] = "",
                    [10] = "", [11] = "", [12] = "", [13] = "",
                    [14] = "default:cobble", [15] = "", [16] = "", [17] = "",
                    [18] = "", [19] = "", [20] = "default:cobble", [21] = "",
                    [22] = "", [23] = "", [24] = "", [25] = "", [26] = "",
                    [27] = "", [28] = "", [29] = "", [30] = "", [31] = "",
                    [32] = ""}
        },
        fields = {
            formspec = "size[8,9]list[context;main;0,0;8,4;]list[current_player;main;0,5;8,4;]",
            infotext = "Chest"
        }
    })

Formspec
--------
Formspec defines a menu. Currently not much else than inventories are
supported. It is a string, with a somewhat strange format.

Spaces and newlines can be inserted between the blocks, as is used in the
examples.

### Examples

#### Chest

    size[8,9]
    list[context;main;0,0;8,4;]
    list[current_player;main;0,5;8,4;]

#### Furnace

    size[8,9]
    list[context;fuel;2,3;1,1;]
    list[context;src;2,1;1,1;]
    list[context;dst;5,1;2,2;]
    list[current_player;main;0,5;8,4;]

#### Minecraft-like player inventory

    size[8,7.5]
    image[1,0.6;1,2;player.png]
    list[current_player;main;0,3.5;8,4;]

Inventory locations
-------------------
* `"context"`: Selected node metadata (deprecated: `"current_name"`)
* `"current_player"`: Player to whom the menu is shown
* `"player:<name>"`: Any player
* `"nodemeta:<X>,<Y>,<Z>"`: Any node metadata
* `"detached:<name>"`: A detached inventory

`ColorString`
-------------
`#RGB` defines a color in hexadecimal format.

`#RGBA` defines a color in hexadecimal format and alpha channel.

`#RRGGBB` defines a color in hexadecimal format.

`#RRGGBBAA` defines a color in hexadecimal format and alpha channel.

Named colors are also supported and are equivalent to
[CSS Color Module Level 4](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-color/#named-colors).
To specify the value of the alpha channel, append `#AA` to the end of the color name
(e.g. `colorname#08`). For named colors the hexadecimal string representing the alpha
value must (always) be two hexadecimal digits.

`ColorSpec`
-----------
A ColorSpec specifies a 32-bit color.  It can be written in either:
table form, each element ranging from 0..255 (a, if absent, defaults to 255):
    `colorspec = {a=255, r=0, g=255, b=0}`
numerical form, the raw integer value of an ARGB8 quad:
    `colorspec = 0xFF00FF00`
or string form, a ColorString (defined above):
    `colorspec = "green"`

    * `force_placement` is a boolean indicating whether nodes other than `air` and
      `ignore` are replaced by the schematic

* `minetest.serialize_schematic(schematic, format, options)`
    * Return the serialized schematic specified by schematic (see: Schematic specifier)
    * in the `format` of either "mts" or "lua".
    * "mts" - a string containing the binary MTS data used in the MTS file format
    * "lua" - a string containing Lua code representing the schematic in table format
    * `options` is a table containing the following optional parameters:
    * If `lua_use_comments` is true and `format` is "lua", the Lua code generated will have (X, Z)
    * position comments for every X row generated in the schematic data for easier reading.
    * If `lua_num_indent_spaces` is a nonzero number and `format` is "lua", the Lua code generated
    * will use that number of spaces as indentation instead of a tab character.

* `minetest.parse_json(string[, nullvalue])`: returns something
    * Convert a string containing JSON data into the Lua equivalent
    * `nullvalue`: returned in place of the JSON null; defaults to `nil`
    * On success returns a table, a string, a number, a boolean or `nullvalue`
    * On failure outputs an error message and returns `nil`
    * Example: `parse_json("[10, {\"a\":false}]")`, returns `{10, {a = false}}`
* `minetest.write_json(data[, styled])`: returns a string or `nil` and an error message
    * Convert a Lua table into a JSON string
    * styled: Outputs in a human-readable format if this is set, defaults to false
    * Unserializable things like functions and userdata are saved as null.
    * **Warning**: JSON is more strict than the Lua table format.
        1. You can only use strings and positive integers of at least one as keys.
        2. You can not mix string and integer keys.
           This is due to the fact that JSON has two distinct array and object values.
    * Example: `write_json({10, {a = false}})`, returns `"[10, {\"a\": false}]"`
* `minetest.serialize(table)`: returns a string
    * Convert a table containing tables, strings, numbers, booleans and `nil`s
      into string form readable by `minetest.deserialize`
    * Example: `serialize({foo='bar'})`, returns `'return { ["foo"] = "bar" }'`
* `minetest.deserialize(string)`: returns a table
    * Convert a string returned by `minetest.deserialize` into a table
    * `string` is loaded in an empty sandbox environment.
    * Will load functions, but they cannot access the global environment.
    * Example: `deserialize('return { ["foo"] = "bar" }')`, returns `{foo='bar'}`
    * Example: `deserialize('print("foo")')`, returns `nil` (function call fails)
        * `error:[string "print("foo")"]:1: attempt to call global 'print' (a nil value)`
* `minetest.compress(data, method, ...)`: returns `compressed_data`
    * Compress a string of data.
    * `method` is a string identifying the compression method to be used.
    * Supported compression methods:
    *     Deflate (zlib): `"deflate"`
    * `...` indicates method-specific arguments.  Currently defined arguments are:
    *     Deflate: `level` - Compression level, `0`-`9` or `nil`.
* `minetest.decompress(compressed_data, method, ...)`: returns data
    * Decompress a string of data (using ZLib).
    * See documentation on `minetest.compress()` for supported compression methods.
    * currently supported.
    * `...` indicates method-specific arguments. Currently, no methods use this.
* `minetest.is_protected(pos, name)`: returns boolean
    * Returns true, if player `name` shouldn't be abled to dig at `pos` or do other
      actions, defineable by mods, due to some mod-defined ownership-like concept.
      Returns false or nil, if the player is allowed to do such actions.
    * This function should be overridden by protection mods and should be used to
      check if a player can interact at a position.
    * This function should call the old version of itself if the position is not
      protected by the mod.
    * Example:

            local old_is_protected = minetest.is_protected
            function minetest.is_protected(pos, name)
                if mymod:position_protected_from(pos, name) then
                    return true
                end
                    return old_is_protected(pos, name)
            end
* `minetest.record_protection_violation(pos, name)`
     * This function calls functions registered with
       `minetest.register_on_protection_violation`.
* `minetest.rotate_and_place(itemstack, placer, pointed_thing, infinitestacks, orient_flags)`
    * Attempt to predict the desired orientation of the facedir-capable node
      defined by `itemstack`, and place it accordingly (on-wall, on the floor, or
      hanging from the ceiling). Stacks are handled normally if the `infinitestacks`
      field is false or omitted (else, the itemstack is not changed). `orient_flags`
      is an optional table containing extra tweaks to the placement code:
        * `invert_wall`:   if `true`, place wall-orientation on the ground and ground-
    orientation on the wall.
        * `force_wall` :   if `true`, always place the node in wall orientation.
        * `force_ceiling`: if `true`, always place on the ceiling.
        * `force_floor`:   if `true`, always place the node on the floor.
        * `force_facedir`: if `true`, forcefully reset the facedir to north when placing on
          the floor or ceiling
        * The first four options are mutually-exclusive; the last in the list takes
          precedence over the first.
* `minetest.rotate_node(itemstack, placer, pointed_thing)`
    * calls `rotate_and_place()` with infinitestacks set according to the state of
       the creative mode setting, and checks for "sneak" to set the `invert_wall`
       parameter.

* `minetest.forceload_block(pos)`
    * forceloads the position `pos`.
    * returns `true` if area could be forceloaded
    * Please note that forceloaded areas are saved when the server restarts.

* `minetest.forceload_free_block(pos)`
    * stops forceloading the position `pos`

* `minetest.request_insecure_environment()`: returns an environment containing
  insecure functions if the calling mod has been listed as trusted in the
  `secure.trusted_mods` setting or security is disabled, otherwise returns `nil`.
    * Only works at init time.

### `AreaStore`
A fast access data structure to store areas, and find areas near a given position or area.
Every area has a `data` string attribute to store additional information.
You can create an empty `AreaStore` by calling `AreaStore()`, or `AreaStore(type_name)`.
If you chose the parameter-less constructor, a fast implementation will be automatically chosen for you.

#### Methods
* `get_area(id, include_borders, include_data)`: returns the area with the id `id`. (optional) Boolean values `include_borders` and `include_data` control what's copied.
* `get_areas_for_pos(pos, include_borders, include_data)`: returns all areas that contain the position `pos`. (optional) Boolean values `include_borders` and `include_data` control what's copied.
* `get_areas_in_area(edge1, edge2, accept_overlap, include_borders, include_data)`: returns all areas that contain all nodes inside the area specified by `edge1` and `edge2` (inclusive). If `accept_overlap` is true, also areas are returned that have nodes in common with the specified area. (optional) Boolean values `include_borders` and `include_data` control what's copied.
* `insert_area(edge1, edge2, data)`: inserts an area into the store. Returns the id if successful, nil otherwise. The (inclusive) positions `edge1` and `edge2` describe the area, `data`
is a string stored with the area.
* `reserve(count)`: reserves resources for at most `count` many contained areas. Only needed for efficiency, and only some implementations profit.
* `remove_area(id)`: removes the area with the given id from the store, returns success.
* `set_cache_params(params)`: sets params for the included prefiltering cache. Calling invalidates the cache, so that its elements have to be newly generated.
    * `params`:
      {
        enabled = boolean, -- whether to enable, default true
        block_radius = number, -- the radius (in nodes) of the areas the cache generates prefiltered lists for, minimum 16, default 64
        limit = number, -- the cache's size, minimum 20, default 1000
      }

  Clears item on failure.
* `get_metadata()`: Returns metadata (a string attached to an item stack).
* `set_metadata(metadata)`: Returns true.
* `clear()`: removes all items from the stack, making it empty.
* `replace(item)`: replace the contents of this stack.
    * `item` can also be an itemstring or table.

* `to_table()`: Returns the stack in Lua table form.
* `get_stack_max()`: Returns the maximum size of the stack (depends on the item).
* `get_free_space()`: Returns `get_stack_max() - get_count()`.
* `is_known()`: Returns `true` if the item name refers to a defined item type.
* `get_definition()`: Returns the item definition table.
* `get_tool_capabilities()`: Returns the digging properties of the item,
  or those of the hand if none are defined for this item type

### `PseudoRandom`
A 16-bit pseudorandom number generator.
Uses a well-known LCG algorithm introduced by K&R.

It can be created via `PseudoRandom(seed)`.

#### Methods
* `next()`: return next integer random number [`0`...`32767`]
* `next(min, max)`: return next integer random number [`min`...`max`]
    * `((max - min) == 32767) or ((max-min) <= 6553))` must be true
      due to the simple implementation making bad distribution otherwise.

### `PcgRandom`
A 32-bit pseudorandom number generator.
Uses PCG32, an algorithm of the permuted congruential generator family, offering very strong randomness.

It can be created via `PcgRandom(seed)` or `PcgRandom(seed, sequence)`.

#### Methods
* `next()`: return next integer random number [`-2147483648`...`2147483647`]
* `next(min, max)`: return next integer random number [`min`...`max`]
* `rand_normal_dist(min, max, num_trials=6)`: return normally distributed random number [`min`...`max`]
    * This is only a rough approximation of a normal distribution with mean=(max-min)/2 and variance=1
    * Increasing num_trials improves accuracy of the approximation

### `PerlinNoise`
A perlin noise generator.
It can be created via `PerlinNoise(seed, octaves, persistence, scale)`
or `PerlinNoise(noiseparams)`.
Alternatively with `minetest.get_perlin(seeddiff, octaves, persistence, scale)`
or `minetest.get_perlin(noiseparams)`.

#### Methods
* `get2d(pos)`: returns 2D noise value at `pos={x=,y=}`
* `get3d(pos)`: returns 3D noise value at `pos={x=,y=,z=}`

### `PerlinNoiseMap`
A fast, bulk perlin noise generator.

It can be created via `PerlinNoiseMap(noiseparams, size)` or
`minetest.get_perlin_map(noiseparams, size)`.

Format of `size` is `{x=dimx, y=dimy, z=dimz}`.  The `z` conponent is ommitted
for 2D noise, and it must be must be larger than 1 for 3D noise (otherwise
`nil` is returned).

For each of the functions with an optional `buffer` parameter:  If `buffer` is not
nil, this table will be used to store the result instead of creating a new table.


#### Methods
* `get2dMap(pos)`: returns a `<size.x>` times `<size.y>` 2D array of 2D noise
  with values starting at `pos={x=,y=}`
* `get3dMap(pos)`: returns a `<size.x>` times `<size.y>` times `<size.z>` 3D array
  of 3D noise with values starting at `pos={x=,y=,z=}`
* `get2dMap_flat(pos, buffer)`: returns a flat `<size.x * size.y>` element array of 2D noise
  with values starting at `pos={x=,y=}`
* `get3dMap_flat(pos, buffer)`: Same as `get2dMap_flat`, but 3D noise
* `calc2dMap(pos)`: Calculates the 2d noise map starting at `pos`.  The result is stored internally.
* `calc3dMap(pos)`: Calculates the 3d noise map starting at `pos`.  The result is stored internally.
* `getMapSlice(slice_offset, slice_size, buffer)`: In the form of an array, returns a slice of the
  most recently computed noise results.  The result slice begins at coordinates `slice_offset` and
  takes a chunk of `slice_size`.
  E.g. to grab a 2-slice high horizontal 2d plane of noise starting at buffer offset y = 20:
  `noisevals = noise:getMapSlice({y=20}, {y=2})`
  It is important to note that `slice_offset` offset coordinates begin at 1, and are relative to
  the starting position of the most recently calculated noise.
  To grab a single vertical column of noise starting at map coordinates x = 1023, y=1000, z = 1000:
  `noise:calc3dMap({x=1000, y=1000, z=1000})`
  `noisevals = noise:getMapSlice({x=24, z=1}, {x=1, z=1})`

--------------
A mapgen object is a construct used in map generation. Mapgen objects can be used
by an `on_generate` callback to speed up operations by avoiding unnecessary
recalculations; these can be retrieved using the `minetest.get_mapgen_object()`
function. If the requested Mapgen object is unavailable, or `get_mapgen_object()`
was called outside of an `on_generate()` callback, `nil` is returned.

The following Mapgen objects are currently available:

### `voxelmanip`
This returns three values; the `VoxelManip` object to be used, minimum and maximum
emerged position, in that order. All mapgens support this object.

### `heightmap`
Returns an array containing the y coordinates of the ground levels of nodes in
the most recently generated chunk by the current mapgen.

### `biomemap`
Returns an array containing the biome IDs of nodes in the most recently
generated chunk by the current mapgen.

### `heatmap`
Returns an array containing the temperature values of nodes in the most
recently generated chunk by the current mapgen.

### `humiditymap`
Returns an array containing the humidity values of nodes in the most recently
generated chunk by the current mapgen.

### `gennotify`
Returns a table mapping requested generation notification types to arrays of
positions at which the corresponding generated structures are located at within
the current chunk. To set the capture of positions of interest to be recorded
on generate, use `minetest.set_gen_notify()`.

Possible fields of the table returned are:

* `dungeon`
* `temple`
* `cave_begin`
* `cave_end`
* `large_cave_begin`
* `large_cave_end`
* `decoration`

Decorations have a key in the format of `"decoration#id"`, where `id` is the
numeric unique decoration ID.

Registered entities
-------------------
* Functions receive a "luaentity" as `self`:
    * It has the member `.name`, which is the registered name `("mod:thing")`
    * It has the member `.object`, which is an `ObjectRef` pointing to the object
    * The original prototype stuff is visible directly via a metatable
* Callbacks:
    * `on_activate(self, staticdata)`
        * Called when the object is instantiated.
    * `on_step(self, dtime)`
        * Called on every server tick, after movement and collision processing.
          `dtime` is usually 0.1 seconds, as per the `dedicated_server_step` setting
          `in minetest.conf`.
    * `on_punch(self, puncher, time_from_last_punch, tool_capabilities, dir`
        * Called when somebody punches the object.
        * Note that you probably want to handle most punches using the
          automatic armor group system.
          * `puncher`: an `ObjectRef` (can be `nil`)
          * `time_from_last_punch`: Meant for disallowing spamming of clicks (can be `nil`)
          * `tool_capabilities`: capability table of used tool (can be `nil`)
          * `dir`: unit vector of direction of punch. Always defined. Points from
            the puncher to the punched.
    * `on_rightclick(self, clicker)`
    * `get_staticdata(self)`
        * Should return a string that will be passed to `on_activate` when
          the object is instantiated the next time.
