Minetest Lua Modding API Reference 0.4.dev
==========================================
More information at http://c55.me/minetest/

Introduction
-------------
Content and functionality can be added to Minetest 0.4 by using Lua
scripting in run-time loaded mods.

A mod is a self-contained bunch of scripts, textures and other related
things that is loaded by and interfaces with Minetest.

Mods are contained and ran solely on the server side. Definitions and media
files are automatically transferred to the client.

If you see a deficiency in the API, feel free to attempt to add the
functionality in the engine and API. You can send such improvements as
source code patches to <celeron55@gmail.com>.

Programming in Lua
-------------------
If you have any difficulty in understanding this, please read:
  http://www.lua.org/pil/

Startup
--------
Mods are loaded during server startup from the mod load paths by running
the init.lua scripts in a shared environment.

Mod load path
-------------
Generic:
  $path_share/games/gameid/mods/
  $path_share/mods/gameid/
  $path_user/games/gameid/mods/
  $path_user/mods/gameid/ <-- User-installed mods
  $worldpath/worldmods/

In a run-in-place version (eg. the distributed windows version):
  minetest-0.4.x/games/gameid/mods/
  minetest-0.4.x/mods/gameid/ <-- User-installed mods
  minetest-0.4.x/worlds/worldname/worldmods/

On an installed version on linux:
  /usr/share/minetest/games/gameid/mods/
  ~/.minetest/mods/gameid/ <-- User-installed mods
  ~/.minetest/worlds/worldname/worldmods

Mod load path for world-specific games
--------------------------------------
It is possible to include a game in a world; in this case, no mods or
games are loaded or checked from anywhere else.

This is useful for eg. adventure worlds.

This happens if the following directory exists:
  $world/game/

Mods should be then be placed in:
  $world/game/mods/

Modpack support
----------------
Mods can be put in a subdirectory, if the parent directory, which otherwise
should be a mod, contains a file named modpack.txt. This file shall be
empty, except for lines starting with #, which are comments.

Mod directory structure
------------------------
mods
|-- modname
|   |-- depends.txt
|   |-- init.lua
|   |-- textures
|   |   |-- modname_stuff.png
|   |   `-- modname_something_else.png
|   |-- sounds
|   |-- media
|   `-- <custom data>
`-- another

modname:
  The location of this directory can be fetched by using
  minetest.get_modpath(modname)

depends.txt:
  List of mods that have to be loaded before loading this mod.
  A single line contains a single modname.

init.lua:
  The main Lua script. Running this script should register everything it
  wants to register. Subsequent execution depends on minetest calling the
  registered callbacks.

  minetest.setting_get(name) and minetest.setting_getbool(name) can be used
  to read custom or existing settings at load time, if necessary.

textures, sounds, media:
  Media files (textures, sounds, whatever) that will be transferred to the
  client and will be available for use by the mod.

Naming convention for registered textual names
----------------------------------------------
Registered names should generally be in this format:
  "modname:<whatever>" (<whatever> can have characters a-zA-Z0-9_)

This is to prevent conflicting names from corrupting maps and is
enforced by the mod loader.

Example: mod "experimental", ideal item/node/entity name "tnt":
         -> the name should be "experimental:tnt".

Enforcement can be overridden by prefixing the name with ":". This can
be used for overriding the registrations of some other mod.

Example: Any mod can redefine experimental:tnt by using the name
         ":experimental:tnt" when registering it.
(also that mod is required to have "experimental" as a dependency)

The ":" prefix can also be used for maintaining backwards compatibility.

Aliases
-------
Aliases can be added by using minetest.register_alias(name, convert_to)

This will make Minetest to convert things called name to things called
convert_to.

This can be used for maintaining backwards compatibility.

This can be also used for setting quick access names for things, eg. if
you have an item called epiclylongmodname:stuff, you could do
  minetest.register_alias("stuff", "epiclylongmodname:stuff")
and be able to use "/giveme stuff".

Textures
--------
Mods should generally prefix their textures with modname_, eg. given
the mod name "foomod", a texture could be called
  "foomod_foothing.png"

Textures are referred to by their complete name, or alternatively by
stripping out the file extension:
  eg. foomod_foothing.png
  eg. foomod_foothing

Sounds
-------
Only OGG files are supported.

For positional playing of sounds, only single-channel (mono) files are
supported. Otherwise OpenAL will play them non-positionally.

Mods should generally prefix their sounds with modname_, eg. given
the mod name "foomod", a sound could be called
  "foomod_foosound.ogg"

Sounds are referred to by their name with a dot, a single digit and the
file extension stripped out.  When a sound is played, the actual sound file
is chosen randomly from the matching sounds.

When playing the sound "foomod_foosound", the sound is chosen randomly
from the available ones of the following files:
  foomod_foosound.ogg
  foomod_foosound.0.ogg
  foomod_foosound.1.ogg
  ...
  foomod_foosound.9.ogg

Examples of sound parameter tables:
-- Play locationless on all clients
{
	gain = 1.0, -- default
}
-- Play locationless to a player
{
	to_player = name,
	gain = 1.0, -- default
}
-- Play in a location
{
	pos = {x=1,y=2,z=3},
	gain = 1.0, -- default
	max_hear_distance = 32, -- default
}
-- Play connected to an object, looped
{
    object = <an ObjectRef>,
    gain = 1.0, -- default
    max_hear_distance = 32, -- default
    loop = true, -- only sounds connected to objects can be looped
}

SimpleSoundSpec:
eg. ""
eg. "default_place_node"
eg. {}
eg. {name="default_place_node"}
eg. {name="default_place_node", gain=1.0}

Registered definitions of stuff
--------------------------------
Anything added using certain minetest.register_* functions get added to
the global minetest.registered_* tables.

minetest.register_entity(name, prototype table)
 -> minetest.registered_entities[name]

minetest.register_node(name, node definition)
 -> minetest.registered_items[name]
 -> minetest.registered_nodes[name]

minetest.register_tool(name, item definition)
 -> minetest.registered_items[name]

minetest.register_craftitem(name, item definition)
 -> minetest.registered_items[name]

Note that in some cases you will stumble upon things that are not contained
in these tables (eg. when a mod has been removed). Always check for
existence before trying to access the fields.

Example: If you want to check the drawtype of a node, you could do:

local function get_nodedef_field(nodename, fieldname)
    if not minetest.registered_nodes[nodename] then
        return nil
    end
    return minetest.registered_nodes[nodename][fieldname]
end
local drawtype = get_nodedef_field(nodename, "drawtype")

Example: minetest.get_item_group(name, group) has been implemented as:

function minetest.get_item_group(name, group)
	if not minetest.registered_items[name] or not
			minetest.registered_items[name].groups[group] then
		return 0
	end
	return minetest.registered_items[name].groups[group]
end

Nodes
------
Nodes are the bulk data of the world: cubes and other things that take the
space of a cube. Huge amounts of them are handled efficiently, but they
are quite static.

The definition of a node is stored and can be accessed by name in
  minetest.registered_nodes[node.name]
See "Registered definitions of stuff".

Nodes are passed by value between Lua and the engine.
They are represented by a table:
  {name="name", param1=num, param2=num}

param1 and param2 are 8 bit and 4 bit integers, respectively. The engine
uses them for certain automated functions. If you don't use these
functions, you can use them to store arbitrary values.

The functions of param1 and param2 are determined by certain fields in the
node definition:
param1 is reserved for the engine when paramtype != "none":
  paramtype = "light"
  ^ The value stores light with and without sun in it's
    upper and lower 4 bits.
param2 is reserved for the engine when any of these are used:
  liquidtype == "flowing"
  ^ The level and some flags of the liquid is stored in param2
  drawtype == "flowingliquid"
  ^ The drawn liquid level is read from param2
  drawtype == "torchlike"
  drawtype == "signlike"
  paramtype2 == "wallmounted"
  ^ The rotation of the node is stored in param2. You can make this value
    by using minetest.dir_to_wallmounted().
  paramtype2 == "facedir"
  ^ The rotation of the node is stored in param2. Furnaces and chests are
    rotated this way. Can be made by using minetest.dir_to_facedir().

Representations of simple things
--------------------------------
Position/vector:
  {x=num, y=num, z=num}
Currently the API does not provide any helper functions for addition,
subtraction and whatever; you can define those that you need yourself.

Items
------
Node (register_node):
  A node from the world
Tool (register_tool):
  A tool/weapon that can dig and damage things according to tool_capabilities
Craftitem (register_craftitem):
  A miscellaneous item

Items and item stacks can exist in three formats:

Serialized; This is called stackstring or itemstring:
eg. 'default:dirt 5'
eg. 'default:pick_wood 21323'
eg. 'default:apple'

Table format:
eg. {name="default:dirt", count=5, wear=0, metadata=""} 
    ^ 5 dirt nodes
eg. {name="default:pick_wood", count=1, wear=21323, metadata=""}
    ^ a wooden pick about 1/3 weared out
eg. {name="default:apple", count=1, wear=0, metadata=""}
    ^ an apple.

ItemStack:
C++ native format with many helper methods. Useful for converting between
formats. See the Class reference section for details.

When an item must be passed to a function, it can usually be in any of
these formats.

Groups
-------
In a number of places, there is a group table. Groups define the
properties of a thing (item, node, armor of entity, capabilities of
tool) in such a way that the engine and other mods can can interact with
the thing without actually knowing what the thing is.

Usage:
- Groups are stored in a table, having the group names with keys and the
  group ratings as values. For example:
    groups = {crumbly=3, soil=1}
    ^ Default dirt (soil group actually currently not defined; TODO)
    groups = {crumbly=2, soil=1, level=2, outerspace=1}
    ^ A more special dirt-kind of thing
- Groups always have a rating associated with them. If there is no
  useful meaning for a rating for an enabled group, it shall be 1.
- When not defined, the rating of a group defaults to 0. Thus when you
  read groups, you must interpret nil and 0 as the same value, 0.

You can read the rating of a group for an item or a node by using
  minetest.get_item_group(itemname, groupname)

Groups of items
----------------
Groups of items can define what kind of an item it is (eg. wool).

Groups of nodes
----------------
In addition to the general item things, groups are used to define whether
a node is destroyable and how long it takes to destroy by a tool.

Groups of entities
-------------------
For entities, groups are, as of now, used only for calculating damage.

object.get_armor_groups() -> a group-rating table (eg. {fleshy=3})
object.set_armor_groups({level=2, fleshy=2, cracky=2})

Groups of tools
----------------
Groups in tools define which groups of nodes and entities they are
effective towards.

Groups in crafting recipes
---------------------------
- Not implemented yet. (TODO)
- Will probably look like this:
{
    output = 'food:meat_soup_raw',
    recipe = {
        {'group:meat'},
        {'group:water'},
        {'group:bowl'},
    },
    preserve = {'group:bowl'},
}

Special groups
---------------
- immortal: Disables the group damage system for an entity
- level: Can be used to give an additional sense of progression in the game.
  - A larger level will cause eg. a weapon of a lower level make much less
    damage, and get weared out much faster, or not be able to get drops
	from destroyed nodes.
  - 0 is something that is directly accessible at the start of gameplay
  - There is no upper limit
- dig_immediate: (player can always pick up node without tool wear)
  - 2: node is removed without tool wear after 0.5 seconds or so
       (rail, sign)
  - 3: node is removed without tool wear immediately (torch)

Known damage and digging time defining groups
----------------------------------------------
Valid ratings for these are 0, 1, 2 and 3, unless otherwise stated.
- crumbly: dirt, sand
- cracky: tough but crackable stuff like stone.
- snappy: something that can be cut using fine tools; eg. leaves, small
          plants, wire, sheets of metal
- choppy: something that can be cut using force; eg. trees, wooden planks
- fleshy: Living things like animals and the player. This could imply
          some blood effects when hitting.
- explody: Especially prone to explosions
- oddly_breakable_by_hand:
   Can be added to nodes that shouldn't logically be breakable by the
   hand but are. Somewhat similar to dig_immediate, but times are more
   like {[1]=3.50,[2]=2.00,[3]=0.70} and this does not override the
   speed of a tool if the tool can dig at a faster speed than this
   suggests for the hand.

Examples of custom groups
--------------------------
Item groups are often used for defining, well, //groups of items//.
- meat: any meat-kind of a thing (rating might define the size or healing
  ability or be irrelevant - it is not defined as of yet)
- eatable: anything that can be eaten. Rating might define HP gain in half
  hearts.
- flammable: can be set on fire. Rating might define the intensity of the
  fire, affecting eg. the speed of the spreading of an open fire.
- wool: any wool (any origin, any color)
- metal: any metal
- weapon: any weapon
- heavy: anything considerably heavy

Digging time calculation specifics
-----------------------------------
Groups such as **crumbly**, **cracky** and **snappy** are used for this
purpose. Rating is 1, 2 or 3. A higher rating for such a group implies
faster digging time.

The **level** group is used to limit the toughness of nodes a tool can dig
and to scale the digging times / damage to a greater extent.

^ PLEASE DO UNDERSTAND THIS, otherwise you cannot use the system to it's
  full potential.

Tools define their properties by a list of parameters for groups. They
cannot dig other groups; thus it is important to use a standard bunch of
groups to enable interaction with tools.

**Tools define:**
  * Full punch interval
  * Maximum drop level
  * For an arbitrary list of groups:
    * Uses (until the tool breaks)
    * Maximum level (usually 0, 1, 2 or 3)
    * Digging times

**Full punch interval**:
When used as a weapon, the tool will do full damage if this time is spent
between punches. If eg. half the time is spent, the tool will do half
damage.

**Maximum drop level**
Suggests the maximum level of node, when dug with the tool, that will drop
it's useful item. (eg. iron ore to drop a lump of iron).
- This is not automated; it is the responsibility of the node definition
  to implement this

**Uses**
Determines how many uses the tool has when it is used for digging a node,
of this group, of the maximum level. For lower leveled nodes, the use count
is multiplied by 3^leveldiff.
- uses=10, leveldiff=0 -> actual uses: 10
- uses=10, leveldiff=1 -> actual uses: 30
- uses=10, leveldiff=2 -> actual uses: 90

**Maximum level**
Tells what is the maximum level of a node of this group that the tool will
be able to dig.

**Digging times**
List of digging times for different ratings of the group, for nodes of the
maximum level.
  * For example, as a lua table, ''times={2=2.00, 3=0.70}''. This would
    result in the tool to be able to dig nodes that have a rating of 2 or 3
    for this group, and unable to dig the rating 1, which is the toughest.
    Unless there is a matching group that enables digging otherwise.
  * For entities, damage equals the amount of nodes dug in the time spent
    between hits, with a maximum time of ''full_punch_interval''.

Example definition of the capabilities of a tool
-------------------------------------------------
tool_capabilities = {
	full_punch_interval=1.5,
	max_drop_level=1,
	groupcaps={
		crumbly={maxlevel=2, uses=20, times={[1]=1.60, [2]=1.20, [3]=0.80}}
	}
}

This makes the tool be able to dig nodes that fullfill both of these:
- Have the **crumbly** group
- Have a **level** group less or equal to 2

Table of resulting digging times:
crumbly        0     1     2     3     4  <- level
     ->  0     -     -     -     -     -
         1  0.80  1.60  1.60     -     -
         2  0.60  1.20  1.20     -     -
         3  0.40  0.80  0.80     -     -

level diff:    2     1     0    -1    -2

Table of resulting tool uses:
     ->  0     -     -     -     -     -
         1   180    60    20     -     -
         2   180    60    20     -     -
         3   180    60    20     -     -

Notes:
- At crumbly=0, the node is not diggable.
- At crumbly=3, the level difference digging time divider kicks in and makes
  easy nodes to be quickly breakable.
- At level > 2, the node is not diggable, because it's level > maxlevel

Entity damage mechanism
------------------------
Damage calculation:
- Take the time spent after the last hit
- Limit time to full_punch_interval
- Take the damage groups and imagine a bunch of nodes that have them
- Damage in HP is the amount of nodes destroyed in this time.

Client predicts damage based on damage groups. Because of this, it is able to
give an immediate response when an entity is damaged or dies; the response is
pre-defined somehow (eg. by defining a sprite animation) (not implemented;
TODO).
- Currently a smoke puff will appear when an entity dies.

The group **immortal** completely disables normal damage.

Entities can define a special armor group, which is **punch_operable**. This
group disables the regular damage mechanism for players punching it by hand or
a non-tool item, so that it can do something else than take damage.

On the Lua side, every punch calls ''entity:on_punch(puncher,
time_from_last_punch, tool_capabilities, direction)''. This should never be
called directly, because damage is usually not handled by the entity itself.
  * ''puncher'' is the object performing the punch. Can be nil. Should never be
    accessed unless absolutely required, to encourage interoperability.
  * ''time_from_last_punch'' is time from last punch (by puncher) or nil.
  * ''tool_capabilities'' can be nil.
  * ''direction'' is a unit vector, pointing from the source of the punch to
    the punched object.

To punch an entity/object in Lua, call ''object:punch(puncher,
time_from_last_punch, tool_capabilities, direction)''.
  * Return value is tool wear.
  * Parameters are equal to the above callback.
  * If ''direction'' is nil and ''puncher'' is not nil, ''direction'' will be
    automatically filled in based on the location of ''puncher''.

- next(min, max): return next integer random number [min...max]
                  (max - min) must be 32767 or <= 6553 due to the simple
                  implementation making bad distribution otherwise.

PerlinNoise: A perlin noise generator
- Can be created via PerlinNoise(seed, octaves, persistence, scale)
- Also minetest.env:get_perlin(seeddiff, octaves, persistence, scale)
methods:
- get2d(pos) -> 2d noise value at pos={x=,y=}
- get3d(pos) -> 3d noise value at pos={x=,y=,z=}

Registered entities
--------------------
- Functions receive a "luaentity" as self:
  - It has the member .name, which is the registered name ("mod:thing")
  - It has the member .object, which is an ObjectRef pointing to the object
  - The original prototype stuff is visible directly via a metatable
- Callbacks:
  - on_activate(self, staticdata)
    ^ Called when the object is instantiated.
  - on_step(self, dtime)
    ^ Called on every server tick (dtime is usually 0.05 seconds)
  - on_punch(self, puncher, time_from_last_punch, tool_capabilities, dir)
    ^ Called when somebody punches the object.
    ^ Note that you probably want to handle most punches using the
      automatic armor group system.
    ^ puncher: ObjectRef (can be nil)
    ^ time_from_last_punch: Meant for disallowing spamming of clicks (can be nil)
    ^ tool_capabilities: capability table of used tool (can be nil)
	^ dir: unit vector of direction of punch. Always defined. Points from
	       the puncher to the punched.
  - on_rightclick(self, clicker)
  - get_staticdata(self)
    ^ Should return a string that will be passed to on_activate when
      the object is instantiated the next time.
