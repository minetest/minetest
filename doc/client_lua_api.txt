Minetest Lua Client Modding API Reference 5.4.0
================================================
* More information at <http://www.minetest.net/>
* Developer Wiki: <http://dev.minetest.net/>

Introduction
------------

** WARNING: The client API is currently unstable, and may break/change without warning. **

Content and functionality can be added to Minetest 0.4.15-dev+ by using Lua
scripting in run-time loaded mods.

A mod is a self-contained bunch of scripts, textures and other related
things that is loaded by and interfaces with Minetest.

Transferring client-sided mods from the server to the client is planned, but not implemented yet.

If you see a deficiency in the API, feel free to attempt to add the
functionality in the engine and API. You can send such improvements as
source code patches on GitHub (https://github.com/minetest/minetest).

Programming in Lua
------------------
If you have any difficulty in understanding this, please read
[Programming in Lua](http://www.lua.org/pil/).

Startup
-------
Mods are loaded during client startup from the mod load paths by running
the `init.lua` scripts in a shared environment.

In order to load client-side mods, the following conditions need to be satisfied:

1) `$path_user/minetest.conf` contains the setting `enable_client_modding = true`

2) The client-side mod located in `$path_user/clientmods/<modname>` is added to
    `$path_user/clientmods/mods.conf` as `load_mod_<modname> = true`.

Note: Depending on the remote server's settings, client-side mods might not
be loaded or have limited functionality. See setting `csm_restriction_flags` for reference.

Paths
-----
* `RUN_IN_PLACE=1` (Windows release, local build)
    * `$path_user`: `<build directory>`
    * `$path_share`: `<build directory>`
* `RUN_IN_PLACE=0`: (Linux release)
    * `$path_share`:
        * Linux: `/usr/share/minetest`
        * Windows: `<install directory>/minetest-0.4.x`
    * `$path_user`:
        * Linux: `$HOME/.minetest`
        * Windows: `C:/users/<user>/AppData/minetest` (maybe)

Mod load path
-------------
Generic:

* `$path_share/clientmods/`
* `$path_user/clientmods/` (User-installed mods)

In a run-in-place version (e.g. the distributed windows version):

* `minetest-0.4.x/clientmods/` (User-installed mods)

On an installed version on Linux:

* `/usr/share/minetest/clientmods/`
* `$HOME/.minetest/clientmods/` (User-installed mods)

Modpack support
----------------

Mods can be put in a subdirectory, if the parent directory, which otherwise
should be a mod, contains a file named `modpack.conf`.
The file is a key-value store of modpack details.

* `name`: The modpack name.
* `description`: Description of mod to be shown in the Mods tab of the main
                 menu.

Mod directory structure
------------------------

    clientmods
    ├── modname
    │   ├── mod.conf
    │   ├── init.lua
    └── another

### modname

The location of this directory.

### mod.conf

An (optional) settings file that provides meta information about the mod.

* `name`: The mod name. Allows Minetest to determine the mod name even if the
          folder is wrongly named.
* `description`: Description of mod to be shown in the Mods tab of the main
                 menu.
* `depends`: A comma separated list of dependencies. These are mods that must be
             loaded before this mod.
* `optional_depends`: A comma separated list of optional dependencies.
                      Like a dependency, but no error if the mod doesn't exist.

### `init.lua`

The main Lua script. Running this script should register everything it
wants to register. Subsequent execution depends on minetest calling the
registered callbacks.

**NOTE**: Client mods currently can't provide textures, sounds, or models by
themselves. Any media referenced in function calls must already be loaded
(provided by mods that exist on the server).

Naming convention for registered textual names
----------------------------------------------
Registered names should generally be in this format:

    "modname:<whatever>" (<whatever> can have characters a-zA-Z0-9_)

This is to prevent conflicting names from corrupting maps and is
enforced by the mod loader.

### Example
In the mod `experimental`, there is the ideal item/node/entity name `tnt`.
So the name should be `experimental:tnt`.

Enforcement can be overridden by prefixing the name with `:`. This can
be used for overriding the registrations of some other mod.

Example: Any mod can redefine `experimental:tnt` by using the name

    :experimental:tnt

when registering it.
(also that mod is required to have `experimental` as a dependency)

The `:` prefix can also be used for maintaining backwards compatibility.

Sounds
------
**NOTE: Connecting sounds to objects is not implemented.**

Only Ogg Vorbis files are supported.

For positional playing of sounds, only single-channel (mono) files are
supported. Otherwise OpenAL will play them non-positionally.

Mods should generally prefix their sounds with `modname_`, e.g. given
the mod name "`foomod`", a sound could be called:

    foomod_foosound.ogg

Sounds are referred to by their name with a dot, a single digit and the
file extension stripped out. When a sound is played, the actual sound file
is chosen randomly from the matching sounds.

When playing the sound `foomod_foosound`, the sound is chosen randomly
from the available ones of the following files:

* `foomod_foosound.ogg`
* `foomod_foosound.0.ogg`
* `foomod_foosound.1.ogg`
* (...)
* `foomod_foosound.9.ogg`

Examples of sound parameter tables:

    -- Play locationless
    {
        gain = 1.0, -- default
    }
    -- Play locationless, looped
    {
        gain = 1.0, -- default
        loop = true,
    }
    -- Play in a location
    {
        pos = {x = 1, y = 2, z = 3},
        gain = 1.0, -- default
    }
    -- Play connected to an object, looped
    {
        object = <an ObjectRef>,
        gain = 1.0, -- default
        loop = true,
    }

Looped sounds must either be connected to an object or played locationless.

### SimpleSoundSpec
* e.g. `""`
* e.g. `"default_place_node"`
* e.g. `{}`
* e.g. `{name = "default_place_node"}`
* e.g. `{name = "default_place_node", gain = 1.0}`

Representations of simple things
--------------------------------

### Position/vector

    {x=num, y=num, z=num}

For helper functions see "Vector helpers".

### pointed_thing
* `{type="nothing"}`
* `{type="node", under=pos, above=pos}`
* `{type="object", id=ObjectID}`

Flag Specifier Format
---------------------
Flags using the standardized flag specifier format can be specified in either of
two ways, by string or table.

The string format is a comma-delimited set of flag names; whitespace and
unrecognized flag fields are ignored. Specifying a flag in the string sets the
flag, and specifying a flag prefixed by the string `"no"` explicitly
clears the flag from whatever the default may be.

In addition to the standard string flag format, the schematic flags field can
also be a table of flag names to boolean values representing whether or not the
flag is set. Additionally, if a field with the flag name prefixed with `"no"`
is present, mapped to a boolean of any value, the specified flag is unset.

E.g. A flag field of value

    {place_center_x = true, place_center_y=false, place_center_z=true}

is equivalent to

    {place_center_x = true, noplace_center_y=true, place_center_z=true}

which is equivalent to

    "place_center_x, noplace_center_y, place_center_z"

or even

    "place_center_x, place_center_z"

since, by default, no schematic attributes are set.

Formspec
--------
Formspec defines a menu. It is a string, with a somewhat strange format.

Spaces and newlines can be inserted between the blocks, as is used in the
examples.

### Examples

#### Chest

    size[8,9]
    list[context;main;0,0;8,4;]
    list[current_player;main;0,5;8,4;]

    list[current_player;main;0,5;8,4;]

#### Minecraft-like player inventory

    size[8,7.5]
    image[1,0.6;1,2;player.png]

Minetest namespace reference
------------------------------

### Utilities

* `minetest.get_current_modname()`: returns the currently loading mod's name, when we are loading a mod
* `minetest.get_modpath(modname)`: returns virtual path of given mod including
   the trailing separator. This is useful to load additional Lua files
   contained in your mod:
   e.g. `dofile(minetest.get_modpath(minetest.get_current_modname()) .. "stuff.lua")`
* `minetest.get_language()`: returns two strings
   * the current gettext locale
   * the current language code (the same as used for client-side translations)
* `minetest.get_version()`: returns a table containing components of the

  Use this for informational purposes only. The information in the returned
  table does not represent the capabilities of the engine, nor is it
  reliable or verifiable. Compatible forks will have a different name and
  version entirely. To check for the presence of engine features, test
  whether the functions exported by the wanted features exist. For example:

        1. You can only use strings and positive integers of at least one as keys.
        2. You can not mix string and integer keys.
           This is due to the fact that JSON has two distinct array and object values.

### HUD Definition (`hud_add`, `hud_get`)
```lua
    {
        hud_elem_type = "image", -- see HUD element types, default "text"
    --  ^ type of HUD element, can be either of "image", "text", "statbar", or "inventory"

    }
```

Escape sequences
----------------
Most text can contain escape sequences, that can for example color the text.
There are a few exceptions: tab headers, dropdowns and vertical labels can't.
The following functions provide escape sequences:
* `minetest.get_color_escape_sequence(color)`:
    * `color` is a [ColorString](#colorstring)
    * The escape sequence sets the text color to `color`
* `minetest.colorize(color, message)`:
    * Equivalent to:
      `minetest.get_color_escape_sequence(color) ..
       message ..
       minetest.get_color_escape_sequence("#ffffff")`
* `minetest.get_background_escape_sequence(color)`
    * `color` is a [ColorString](#colorstring)
    * The escape sequence sets the background of the whole text element to
      `color`. Only defined for item descriptions and tooltips.
* `minetest.strip_foreground_colors(str)`
    * Removes foreground colors added by `get_color_escape_sequence`.
* `minetest.strip_background_colors(str)`
    * Removes background colors added by `get_background_escape_sequence`.
* `minetest.strip_colors(str)`
    * Removes all color escape sequences.

`ColorString`
-------------
`#RGB` defines a color in hexadecimal format.

`#RGBA` defines a color in hexadecimal format and alpha channel.

`#RRGGBB` defines a color in hexadecimal format.

`#RRGGBBAA` defines a color in hexadecimal format and alpha channel.

Named colors are also supported and are equivalent to
[CSS Color Module Level 4](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-color/#named-colors).
To specify the value of the alpha channel, append `#AA` to the end of the color name
(e.g. `colorname#08`). For named colors the hexadecimal string representing the alpha
value must (always) be two hexadecimal digits.

`Color`
-------------
`{a = alpha, r = red, g = green, b = blue}` defines an ARGB8 color.

HUD element types
-----------------
The position field is used for all element types.

To account for differing resolutions, the position coordinates are the percentage
of the screen, ranging in value from `0` to `1`.

The name field is not yet used, but should contain a description of what the
HUD element represents. The direction field is the direction in which something
is drawn.

`0` draws from left to right, `1` draws from right to left, `2` draws from
top to bottom, and `3` draws from bottom to top.

The `alignment` field specifies how the item will be aligned. It ranges from `-1` to `1`,
with `0` being the center, `-1` is moved to the left/up, and `1` is to the right/down.
Fractional values can be used.

The `offset` field specifies a pixel offset from the position. Contrary to position,
the offset is not scaled to screen size. This allows for some precisely-positioned
items in the HUD.

**Note**: `offset` _will_ adapt to screen DPI as well as user defined scaling factor!

Below are the specific uses for fields in each type; fields not listed for that type are ignored.

**Note**: Future revisions to the HUD API may be incompatible; the HUD API is still
in the experimental stages.

### `image`
Displays an image on the HUD.

* `scale`: The scale of the image, with 1 being the original texture size.
  Only the X coordinate scale is used (positive values).
  Negative values represent that percentage of the screen it
  should take; e.g. `x=-100` means 100% (width).
* `text`: The name of the texture that is displayed.
* `alignment`: The alignment of the image.
* `offset`: offset in pixels from position.

### `text`
Displays text on the HUD.

* `scale`: Defines the bounding rectangle of the text.
  A value such as `{x=100, y=100}` should work.
* `text`: The text to be displayed in the HUD element.
* `number`: An integer containing the RGB value of the color used to draw the text.
  Specify `0xFFFFFF` for white text, `0xFF0000` for red, and so on.
* `alignment`: The alignment of the text.
* `offset`: offset in pixels from position.

### `statbar`
Displays a horizontal bar made up of half-images.

* `text`: The name of the texture that is used.
* `number`: The number of half-textures that are displayed.
  If odd, will end with a vertically center-split texture.
* `direction`
* `offset`: offset in pixels from position.
* `size`: If used, will force full-image size to this value (override texture pack image size)

### `inventory`
* `text`: The name of the inventory list to be displayed.
* `number`: Number of items in the inventory to be displayed.
* `item`: Position of item that is selected.
* `direction`
* `offset`: offset in pixels from position.

### `waypoint`

Displays distance to selected world position.

* `name`: The name of the waypoint.
* `text`: Distance suffix. Can be blank.
* `precision`: Waypoint precision, integer >= 0. Defaults to 10.
  If set to 0, distance is not shown. Shown value is `floor(distance*precision)/precision`.
  When the precision is an integer multiple of 10, there will be `log_10(precision)` digits after the decimal point.
  `precision = 1000`, for example, will show 3 decimal places (eg: `0.999`).
  `precision = 2` will show multiples of `0.5`; precision = 5 will show multiples of `0.2` and so on:
  `precision = n` will show multiples of `1/n`
* `number:` An integer containing the RGB value of the color used to draw the
  text.
* `world_pos`: World position of the waypoint.
* `offset`: offset in pixels from position.
* `alignment`: The alignment of the waypoint.

### `image_waypoint`

Same as `image`, but does not accept a `position`; the position is instead determined by `world_pos`, the world position of the waypoint.

* `scale`: The scale of the image, with 1 being the original texture size.
  Only the X coordinate scale is used (positive values).
  Negative values represent that percentage of the screen it
  should take; e.g. `x=-100` means 100% (width).
* `text`: The name of the texture that is displayed.
* `alignment`: The alignment of the image.
* `world_pos`: World position of the waypoint.
* `offset`: offset in pixels from position.

        pos = {x=0, y=0, z=0},

        maxexptime = 1,
        minsize = 1,
        maxsize = 1,

    --  ^ minsize/maxsize, minexptime/maxexptime (expirationtime)
        collisiondetection = false,
    --  ^ collisiondetection: if true uses collision detection
        collision_removal = false,
    --  ^ collision_removal: if true then particle is removed when it collides,
    --  ^ requires collisiondetection = true to have any effect
        vertical = false,
    --  ^ vertical: if true faces player using y axis only

    --  ^ Uses texture (string)
    }
