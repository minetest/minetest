Minetest Lua Client Modding API Reference 5.10.0
================================================
* More information at <http://www.minetest.net/>
* Developer Wiki: <http://dev.minetest.net/>

Introduction
------------

** WARNING: The client API is currently unstable, and may break/change without warning. **

Content and functionality can be added to Minetest by using Lua
scripting in run-time loaded mods.

A mod is a self-contained bunch of scripts, textures and other related
things that is loaded by and interfaces with Minetest.

Transferring client-sided mods from the server to the client is planned, but not implemented yet.

If you see a deficiency in the API, feel free to attempt to add the
functionality in the engine and API. You can send such improvements as
source code patches on GitHub (https://github.com/minetest/minetest).

Programming in Lua
------------------
If you have any difficulty in understanding this, please read
[Programming in Lua](http://www.lua.org/pil/).

Startup
-------
Mods are loaded during client startup from the mod load paths by running
the `init.lua` scripts in a shared environment.

In order to load client-side mods, the following conditions need to be satisfied:

1) `$path_user/minetest.conf` contains the setting `enable_client_modding = true`

2) The client-side mod located in `$path_user/clientmods/<modname>` is added to
    `$path_user/clientmods/mods.conf` as `load_mod_<modname> = true`.

Note: Depending on the remote server's settings, client-side mods might not
be loaded or have limited functionality. See setting `csm_restriction_flags` for reference.

Paths
-----
* `RUN_IN_PLACE=1` (Windows release, local build)
    * `$path_user`: `<build directory>`
    * `$path_share`: `<build directory>`
* `RUN_IN_PLACE=0`: (Linux release)
    * `$path_share`:
        * Linux: `/usr/share/minetest`
        * Windows: `<install directory>/minetest-0.4.x`
    * `$path_user`:
        * Linux: `$HOME/.minetest`
        * Windows: `C:/users/<user>/AppData/minetest` (maybe)

Mod load path
-------------
Generic:

* `$path_share/clientmods/`
* `$path_user/clientmods/` (User-installed mods)

In a run-in-place version (e.g. the distributed windows version):

* `minetest/clientmods/` (User-installed mods)

On an installed version on Linux:

* `/usr/share/minetest/clientmods/`
* `$HOME/.minetest/clientmods/` (User-installed mods)

Modpack support
----------------

Mods can be put in a subdirectory, if the parent directory, which otherwise
should be a mod, contains a file named `modpack.conf`.
The file is a key-value store of modpack details.

* `name`: The modpack name.
* `description`: Description of mod to be shown in the Mods tab of the main
                 menu.

Mod directory structure
------------------------

    clientmods
    ├── modname
    │   ├── mod.conf
    │   ├── init.lua
    └── another

### modname

The location of this directory.

### mod.conf

An (optional) settings file that provides meta information about the mod.

* `name`: The mod name. Allows Minetest to determine the mod name even if the
          folder is wrongly named.
* `description`: Description of mod to be shown in the Mods tab of the main
                 menu.
* `depends`: A comma separated list of dependencies. These are mods that must be
             loaded before this mod.
* `optional_depends`: A comma separated list of optional dependencies.
                      Like a dependency, but no error if the mod doesn't exist.

### `init.lua`

The main Lua script. Running this script should register everything it
wants to register. Subsequent execution depends on minetest calling the
registered callbacks.

**NOTE**: Client mods currently can't provide textures, sounds, or models by
themselves. Any media referenced in function calls must already be loaded
(provided by mods that exist on the server).

Naming convention for registered textual names
----------------------------------------------
Registered names should generally be in this format:

    "modname:<whatever>" (<whatever> can have characters a-zA-Z0-9_)

This is to prevent conflicting names from corrupting maps and is
enforced by the mod loader.

### Example
In the mod `experimental`, there is the ideal item/node/entity name `tnt`.
So the name should be `experimental:tnt`.

Enforcement can be overridden by prefixing the name with `:`. This can
be used for overriding the registrations of some other mod.

Example: Any mod can redefine `experimental:tnt` by using the name

    :experimental:tnt

when registering it.
(also that mod is required to have `experimental` as a dependency)

The `:` prefix can also be used for maintaining backwards compatibility.

Sounds
------
**NOTE: Connecting sounds to objects is not implemented.**

Only Ogg Vorbis files are supported.

For positional playing of sounds, only single-channel (mono) files are
supported. Otherwise OpenAL will play them non-positionally.

Mods should generally prefix their sounds with `modname_`, e.g. given
the mod name "`foomod`", a sound could be called:

    foomod_foosound.ogg

Sounds are referred to by their name with a dot, a single digit and the
file extension stripped out. When a sound is played, the actual sound file
is chosen randomly from the matching sounds.

When playing the sound `foomod_foosound`, the sound is chosen randomly
from the available ones of the following files:

* `foomod_foosound.ogg`
* `foomod_foosound.0.ogg`
* `foomod_foosound.1.ogg`
* (...)
* `foomod_foosound.9.ogg`

Examples of sound parameter tables:

```lua
-- Play locationless
{
    gain = 1.0, -- default
}
-- Play locationless, looped
{
    gain = 1.0, -- default
    loop = true,
}
-- Play in a location
{
    pos = {x = 1, y = 2, z = 3},
    gain = 1.0, -- default
}
```

Looped sounds must be played locationless.

### SimpleSoundSpec
* e.g. `""`
* e.g. `"default_place_node"`
* e.g. `{}`
* e.g. `{name = "default_place_node"}`
* e.g. `{name = "default_place_node", gain = 1.0}`

Representations of simple things
--------------------------------

### Position/vector

```lua
{x=num, y=num, z=num}
```

For helper functions see "Vector helpers".

### pointed_thing
* `{type="nothing"}`
* `{type="node", under=pos, above=pos}`
* `{type="object", id=ObjectID}`

Flag Specifier Format
---------------------

Refer to `lua_api.md`.

Formspec
--------

Formspec defines a menu. It is a string, with a somewhat strange format.

For details, refer to `lua_api.md`.

Spatial Vectors
---------------

Refer to `lua_api.md`.

Helper functions
----------------
* `dump2(obj, name="_", dumped={})`
     * Return object serialized as a string, handles reference loops
* `dump(obj, dumped={})`
    * Return object serialized as a string
* `math.hypot(x, y)`
    * Get the hypotenuse of a triangle with legs x and y.

    * If `max_splits` is negative, do not limit splits.
    * `sep_is_pattern` specifies if separator is a plain string or a pattern (regex).
    * e.g. `string:split("a,b", ",") == {"a","b"}`

Minetest namespace reference
------------------------------

### Utilities

* `minetest.get_current_modname()`: returns the currently loading mod's name, when we are loading a mod
* `minetest.get_modpath(modname)`: returns virtual path of given mod including
   the trailing separator. This is useful to load additional Lua files
   contained in your mod:
   e.g. `dofile(minetest.get_modpath(minetest.get_current_modname()) .. "stuff.lua")`
* `minetest.get_language()`: returns two strings
   * the current gettext locale
   * the current language code (the same as used for client-side translations)
* `minetest.get_version()`: returns a table containing components of the
   engine version.  Components:
    * `project`: Name of the project, eg, "Minetest"
    * `string`: Simple version, eg, "1.2.3-dev"
    * `hash`: Full git version (only set if available), eg, "1.2.3-dev-01234567-dirty"
  Use this for informational purposes only. The information in the returned
  table does not represent the capabilities of the engine, nor is it
  reliable or verifiable. Compatible forks will have a different name and
  version entirely. To check for the presence of engine features, test
  whether the functions exported by the wanted features exist. For example:
  `if minetest.check_for_falling then ... end`.
* `minetest.sha1(data, [raw])`: returns the sha1 hash of data
    * `data`: string of data to hash
    * `raw`: return raw bytes instead of hex digits, default: false
* `minetest.colorspec_to_colorstring(colorspec)`: Converts a ColorSpec to a
  ColorString. If the ColorSpec is invalid, returns `nil`.
    * `colorspec`: The ColorSpec to convert
* `minetest.get_csm_restrictions()`: returns a table of `Flags` indicating the
   restrictions applied to the current mod.
   * If a flag in this table is set to true, the feature is RESTRICTED.
   * Possible flags: `load_client_mods`, `chat_messages`, `read_itemdefs`,
                   `read_nodedefs`, `lookup_nodes`, `read_playerinfo`
* `minetest.urlencode(str)`: Encodes non-unreserved URI characters by a
  percent sign followed by two hex digits. See
  [RFC 3986, section 2.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-2.3).

### Logging
* `minetest.debug(...)`
    * Equivalent to `minetest.log(table.concat({...}, "\t"))`
* `minetest.log([level,] text)`
    * `level` is one of `"none"`, `"error"`, `"warning"`, `"action"`,
      `"info"`, or `"verbose"`.  Default is `"none"`.

      the sound volume.
    * `gain` the target gain for the fade.

### Timing
* `minetest.after(time, func, ...)`
    * Call the function `func` after `time` seconds, may be fractional
    * Optional: Variable number of arguments that are passed to `func`
    * Jobs set for earlier times are executed earlier. If multiple jobs expire
      at exactly the same time, then they expire in the order in which they were
      registered. This basically just applies to jobs registered on the same

      for unloaded areas or flavor limited areas.
* `minetest.get_node_light(pos, timeofday)`
    * Gets the light value at the given position. Note that the light value
      "inside" the node at the given position is returned, so you usually want
      to get the light value of a neighbor.
    * `pos`: The position where to measure the light.
    * `timeofday`: `nil` for current time, `0` for night, `0.5` for day

      If true `pos` is also checked for the nodes
* `minetest.find_nodes_in_area(pos1, pos2, nodenames, [grouped])`
    * `pos1` and `pos2` are the min and max positions of the area to search.
    * `nodenames`: e.g. `{"ignore", "group:tree"}` or `"default:dirt"`
    * If `grouped` is true the return value is a table indexed by node name
      which contains lists of positions.
    * If `grouped` is false or absent the return values are as follows:
      first value: Table with all node positions
      second value: Table with the count of each node with the node name

### Mod channels
![Mod channels communication scheme](docs/mod channels.png)

* `minetest.mod_channel_join(channel_name)`
    * Client joins channel `channel_name`, and creates it, if necessary. You
      should listen from incoming messages with `minetest.register_on_modchannel_message`
      call to receive incoming messages. Warning, this function is asynchronous.

### Particles

### Misc.
* `minetest.parse_json(string[, nullvalue])`: returns something
    * Convert a string containing JSON data into the Lua equivalent
    * `nullvalue`: returned in place of the JSON null; defaults to `nil`
    * On success returns a table, a string, a number, a boolean or `nullvalue`
    * On failure outputs an error message and returns `nil`
    * Example: `parse_json("[10, {\"a\":false}]")`, returns `{10, {a = false}}`
* `minetest.write_json(data[, styled])`: returns a string or `nil` and an error message
    * Convert a Lua table into a JSON string
    * styled: Outputs in a human-readable format if this is set, defaults to false
    * Unserializable things like functions and userdata are saved as null.
    * **Warning**: JSON is more strict than the Lua table format.
        1. You can only use strings and positive integers of at least one as keys.
        2. You cannot mix string and integer keys.
           This is due to the fact that JSON has two distinct array and object values.
    * Example: `write_json({10, {a = false}})`, returns `"[10, {\"a\": false}]"`
* `minetest.serialize(table)`: returns a string
    * Convert a table containing tables, strings, numbers, booleans and `nil`s
      into string form readable by `minetest.deserialize`
    * Example: `serialize({foo='bar'})`, returns `'return { ["foo"] = "bar" }'`
* `minetest.deserialize(string)`: returns a table
    * Convert a string returned by `minetest.deserialize` into a table
    * `string` is loaded in an empty sandbox environment.
    * Will load functions, but they cannot access the global environment.
    * Example: `deserialize('return { ["foo"] = "bar" }')`, returns `{foo='bar'}`
    * Example: `deserialize('print("foo")')`, returns `nil` (function call fails)
        * `error:[string "print("foo")"]:1: attempt to call global 'print' (a nil value)`
* `minetest.compress(data, method, ...)`: returns `compressed_data`
    * Compress a string of data.
    * `method` is a string identifying the compression method to be used.
    * Supported compression methods:
        * Deflate (zlib): `"deflate"`
        * Zstandard: `"zstd"`
    * `...` indicates method-specific arguments. Currently defined arguments
      are:
        * Deflate: `level` - Compression level, `0`-`9` or `nil`.
        * Zstandard: `level` - Compression level. Integer or `nil`. Default `3`.
        Note any supported Zstandard compression level could be used here,
        but these are subject to change between Zstandard versions.
* `minetest.decompress(compressed_data, method, ...)`: returns data
    * Decompress a string of data using the algorithm specified by `method`.
    * See documentation on `minetest.compress()` for supported compression
      methods.
    * `...` indicates method-specific arguments. Currently, no methods use this
* `minetest.rgba(red, green, blue[, alpha])`: returns a string
    * Each argument is an 8 Bit unsigned integer
    * Returns the ColorString from rgb or rgba values
    * Example: `minetest.rgba(10, 20, 30, 40)`, returns `"#0A141E28"`
* `minetest.encode_base64(string)`: returns string encoded in base64
    * Encodes a string in base64.
* `minetest.decode_base64(string)`: returns string or nil on failure
    * Padding characters are only supported starting at version 5.4.0, where
      5.5.0 and newer perform proper checks.
    * Decodes a string encoded in base64.
* `minetest.gettext(string)` : returns string
    * look up the translation of a string in the gettext message catalog
* `fgettext_ne(string, ...)`
    * call minetest.gettext(string), replace "$1"..."$9" with the given
      extra arguments and return the result
* `fgettext(string, ...)` : returns string
    * same as fgettext_ne(), but calls minetest.formspec_escape before returning result
* `minetest.pointed_thing_to_face_pos(placer, pointed_thing)`: returns a position
    * returns the exact position on the surface of a pointed node
* `minetest.global_exists(name)`
    * Checks if a global variable has been set, without triggering a warning.

### UI
* `minetest.ui.minimap`

* `minetest.show_formspec(formname, formspec)` : returns true on success
    * Shows a formspec to the player
* `minetest.display_chat_message(message)` returns true on success
    * Shows a chat message to the current player.

Setting-related
---------------

* `minetest.settings`: Settings object containing all of the settings from the
  main config file (`minetest.conf`). Check lua_api.md for class reference.
* `minetest.setting_get_pos(name)`: Loads a setting from the main settings and
  parses it as a position (in the format `(1,2,3)`). Returns a position or nil.

### ModChannel

An interface to use mod channels on client and server

#### Methods
* `leave()`: leave the mod channel.

end
```

The map is loaded as the ray advances. If the map is modified after the
`Raycast` is created, the changes may or may not have an effect on the object.

It can be created via `Raycast(pos1, pos2, objects, liquids)` or
`minetest.raycast(pos1, pos2, objects, liquids)` where:

* `pos1`: start of the ray
* `pos2`: end of the ray
* `objects`: if false, only nodes will be returned. Default is true.
* `liquids`: if false, liquid nodes won't be returned. Default is false.

#### Methods

* `next()`: returns a `pointed_thing` with exact pointing location
    * Returns the next thing pointed by the ray or nil.

Escape sequences
----------------
Most text can contain escape sequences that can for example color the text.
There are a few exceptions: tab headers, dropdowns and vertical labels can't.
The following functions provide escape sequences:
* `minetest.get_color_escape_sequence(color)`:
    * `color` is a [ColorString](#colorstring)
    * The escape sequence sets the text color to `color`
* `minetest.colorize(color, message)`:
    * Equivalent to:
      `minetest.get_color_escape_sequence(color) ..
       message ..
       minetest.get_color_escape_sequence("#ffffff")`
* `minetest.get_background_escape_sequence(color)`
    * `color` is a [ColorString](#colorstring)
    * The escape sequence sets the background of the whole text element to
      `color`. Only defined for item descriptions and tooltips.
* `minetest.strip_foreground_colors(str)`
    * Removes foreground colors added by `get_color_escape_sequence`.
* `minetest.strip_background_colors(str)`
    * Removes background colors added by `get_background_escape_sequence`.
* `minetest.strip_colors(str)`
    * Removes all color escape sequences.

`ColorString`
-------------

Refer to `lua_api.md`.

`Color`
-------------
`{a = alpha, r = red, g = green, b = blue}` defines an ARGB8 color.

### Particle definition (`add_particle`)
