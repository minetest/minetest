    # All of the below libraries (not compilers or build tools) seem
    # like they belong in host conceptually, but CMake can't
    # find them that way for some reason. I think it doesn't really
    # matter since these aren't available as regular conda packages
    # so we'd ask the user to install them system-wide anyways.
