The main game for the Minetest game engine [minetest_game]
==========================================================

To build the wholeness of the Minetest project, insert this repository as
  /games/minetest_game
in the Minetest Engine.

The Minetest Engine can be found in:
  https://github.com/celeron55/minetest/

Compatibility
--------------
The minetest_game github master HEAD is generally compatible with the github
master HEAD of minetest.

Additionally, when the minetest engine is tagged to be a certain version (eg.
0.4.dev-20120326), minetest_game is tagged with the version too.

When stable releases are made, minetest_game is packaged and made available in
  https://github.com/celeron55/minetest_game/downloads
and in case the repository has grown too much, it may be reset. In that sense,
this is not a "real" git repository. (Package maintainers please note!)
