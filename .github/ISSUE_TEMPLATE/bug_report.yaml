        Please note the following:

        1. **Please update Luanti to the latest stable or dev version** before submitting bug reports. Make sure the bug is still reproducible on the latest version.
        2. This page is for reporting the bugs of **the engine itself**. For bugs in a particular game, please [search for the game in the ContentDB](https://content.luanti.org/packages/?type=game) and submit a bug report in their issue trackers.
            * For example, you can submit issues about the Minetest Game [in its own repository](https://github.com/luanti-org/minetest_game/issues).
        3. Please provide as many details as possible for us to spot the problem quicker.
